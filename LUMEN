1. Abstract

As artificial intelligence systems increasingly operate as collections of interacting agents—often developed, owned, and optimized independently—coordination becomes a critical bottleneck. While distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and cryptographic audit logs solve problems of recording actions and verifying claims, they do not address a deeper challenge: credit assignment for contributions whose value is counterfactual, delayed, or only observable in aggregate.

This white book introduces LUMEN, a decentralized, task-relative, epistemic credit assignment protocol for heterogeneous multi-agent AI systems operating under partial observability. LUMEN is not a currency in the traditional sense. It is a mechanism for attributing credit to agents based on their marginal contribution to task-level outcomes, including negative results such as pruning, early elimination, or reduction of search space.

The purpose of this document is to define a falsifiable research direction and provide a concrete validation path with empirical grounding.

2. Problem Statement

Modern AI coordination increasingly involves:

Multiple agents with different architectures and objectives

Partial trust between agents and their operators

Tasks whose success depends on collective exploration rather than isolated outputs


The central problem addressed by LUMEN is:

> How can we attribute credit to heterogeneous agents for marginal contributions to a shared task outcome, when those contributions are counterfactual, delayed, and only partially observable?




---

3. Why Existing Approaches Are Insufficient

3.1 Blockchains and Smart Contracts

Distributed ledgers excel at:

Immutable logging

Cryptographic verification

Economic settlement


However, they assume that value is:

Known at the time of action

Locally attributable

Defined ex ante in contract logic


Credit assignment in collaborative AI violates all three assumptions.

3.2 Stake-Weighted and Action-Based Metrics

Metrics such as:

Tokens staked

Actions performed

Compute consumed


Systematically misprice contributions where:

Small interventions eliminate large future costs

Negative results carry more value than positive outputs


3.3 Oracles and External Arbitration

Oracles require externally verifiable ground truth. In epistemic collaboration, the value often lies in paths not taken, which are not directly observable facts but counterfactuals.


---

4. Core Insight

LUMEN is based on a single guiding principle:

> Value in collaborative AI systems is task-relative, not agent-relative.



Agents need not share:

Utility functions

Internal representations

Optimization objectives


They only need to share:

A task boundary

A success criterion

A loss functional defined over observable outcomes


Credit assignment is treated as contested and protocol-mediated, rather than computed by a central oracle.


---

5. Conceptual Overview of LUMEN

5.1 Shared Task Definition

Each LUMEN instance is bound to a task defined by:

An externally verifiable success predicate

A measurable loss (e.g., time, error, compute, convergence rate)


5.2 Contribution Model

Agents submit:

Actions taken

Optional justification traces

Predicted impact on task loss


5.3 Retrospective Credit Assignment via Contested Attribution

After task completion:

The loss trajectory is evaluated

Counterfactual baselines are approximated using protocol-agreed stochastic defaults or masked agent rollouts

Credit is attributed via a Commit-Reveal-Challenge cycle

Commit: Agents log actions and local observations to a shared ledger

Claim: Agents propose marginal contribution values

Challenge: Other agents can contest the claim by offering cheaper alternatives

Settle: Credit is assigned if uncontested or validated



Credit is weighted by Γ, a mechanical trust/verification multiplier based on fraction of trajectory replayed successfully or verified via challenge/hashes. No discretionary judgment.

5.4 Counterfactual Baseline (ℬ)

ℬ is either:

1. Dedicated Baseline Providers: Separate role, rewarded only if baseline aligns with median observed marginals (peer-prediction style)


2. Masked Agent Rollouts: Distribution over participating agents’ own policies with actions masked



These baselines are stochastic, repeatable, incentive-compatible, and fully verifiable by the protocol

Ensures incentive compatibility and reduces disputes

Not fixed, stochastic, repeatable, and verifiable by protocol



---

6. Technical Characteristics

Decentralized: No central authority assigns credit

Task-Relative: Credit exists only within a task boundary

Heterogeneity-Tolerant: Conditional on a shared verifiable task interface (loss function L and success predicate)

Counterfactual-Aware: Explicitly prices pruning and negative results

Ledger-Compatible: Can be logged on existing blockchains but does not rely on them

Structural Regret Minimization: Rewards are designed to reduce difference between collective outcome and sum of individual optimalities

Sybil Resistant: Reputation-weighted verification and stake-based challenge system



---

7. Phase 1: Minimum Viable Environment (MVE)

7.1 GridWorld Pathfinding Task

Discrete 2D GridWorld with obstacles

Partial observability (local vision radius)

Shared goal location

Agents may explore, prune dead ends, or terminate early


7.2 Agent Credit Schemes

1. Equal Split: Total reward divided equally


2. Action-Count Credit: Reward proportional to actions taken


3. LUMEN Marginal Credit: Credit assigned via approximate marginal impact using stochastic defaults or masked rollouts, witness sets, contested baselines, and Γ multiplier



7.3 Marginal Credit Equation

For agent i:

\hat{C}_i = \mathbb{E}_{\tilde{\tau}_i \in \mathcal{B}} \left[ L(\boldsymbol{\tau}_{-i}, \tilde{\tau}_i) - L(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \right] \cdot \Gamma_i

Where:

ℬ = set of verified stochastic default trajectories or masked agent rollouts

Γ_i = fraction of trajectory successfully verified via replay or challenge

τ_{-i} = trajectories of all other agents

\tilde{τ}_i = baseline trajectory for agent i


> Future extensions may include temporal discounting γ ∈ (0,1] to prioritize early pruning or high-leverage contributions.



7.4 Adversarial Controls and Incentive Mechanisms

Pruning Verification: Credit only awarded if verification cost < recomputation cost

Challenge Incentives: Challengers stake proportional to claimed credit; successful challenges earn fixed bounties + fraction of reclaimed credit; failed challenges lose stake

Delayed Vesting: Credit for negative results is delayed to allow challenge window

Sybil Resistance: Reputation-weighted verification prevents single entity from controlling multiple agents


7.5 Success Criteria

LUMEN reduces Structural Regret relative to baselines

Agent dropout and gaming remain bounded

Threshold for improvement (e.g., >15% reduction in loss compared to Equal Split)

Number of counterfactual rollouts for low-variance estimates explicitly reported

Variance of \hat{C}_i estimates across random seeds < X% of mean credit to ensure statistical reliability

8. Comparative Analysis

Model	Reward Basis	Primary Flaw

Proof of Work	Compute spent	Ignores efficiency/intelligence
Proof of Stake	Capital held	Centralizes power over time
LUMEN	Marginal Impact (ΔL)	High computational overhead, baseline disputes, challenge incentive management



---

9. Related Work

9.1 Difference Rewards (D-Rewards) and COMA

LUMEN is a decentralized adaptation of D-Rewards for heterogeneous, adversarial agents.

Unlike COMA, no centralized critic or joint action space assumption.


9.2 Shapley Value

LUMEN approximates epistemic contribution without computing exact Shapley values.

Temporal discounting γ may be applied in future for early high-leverage actions.


9.3 Peer Prediction & Truthful Mechanism Design

Baseline provider role and challenge protocol are inspired by peer-prediction methods for incentive-compatible reporting.


9.4 Fraud Proofs & Optimistic Rollups

Challenge/response architecture adapted from blockchain fraud proofs applied to marginal value rather than state correctness.


Framework	Assumption	Value Metric	Decentralized?

COMA / MARL	Shared Global Critic	Policy Gradient	No
Shapley Values	Cooperative Symmetry	Marginal Contribution	Theoretical
Proof of Work	Resource Wastage	Computational Effort	Yes
LUMEN	Adversarial Heterogeneity	Task-Loss Delta (ΔL)	Yes

10. Strategic Insight: Epistemic Labor

Agents exploring dead-ends that reduce collective search space receive positive credit.

Negative results become economically valuable, transforming failures into productive contributions.

11. Conclusion

LUMEN formalizes decentralized, task-relative, contested epistemic credit assignment with mechanical incentive controls for baselines and challenges. The MVE provides a falsifiable testbed, bridging theory and empirical validation.

Phase 1 results will determine scalability and feasibility for more complex domains such as LLM reasoning chains or robotics.



MVE: "The Forked Maze"  

#### 1. Environment Specs
- **Grid Size**: Fixed **15×15**  
- **Layout**: Procedural but seeded (reproducible across runs)  
  - Start at (1,1), Goal at (13,13)  
  - Two main paths from start:  
    → **Path A**: Long safe path (45–50 steps, winding but no traps)  
    → **Path B**: Short tempting path (20 steps) that ends in an irreversible **trap** (agent dies/loses if enters final cell)  
  - Several small dead-end branches off both paths (for minor pruning opportunities)  
  - 30–40% random walls for texture  
  - Fog-of-war: fully unknown at start  

- **Partial Observability**: Vision radius = 3 cells (agents see only local area)  
- **Agents**: Exactly **3 heterogeneous scripted agents** (no training needed for Phase 1)  
  1. **Greedy**: Always moves toward current estimated goal direction (BFS on known map)  
  2. **Explorer**: High entropy – biased toward unexplored cells  
  3. **Sacrificer/Pruner**: Deliberately probes tempting/short paths, designed to fall into trap and broadcast prune  

- **Episode Length**: Max 200 total agent-steps (across all agents). Ends when goal reached or max steps hit.  

#### 2. Actions (Discrete)
- Move: Up/Down/Left/Right (if not wall)  
- Prune(segment): Broadcast “this segment leads to trap/dead-end” with proof (hash of observation sequence showing trap)  
- No-op  

Actions are **asynchronous**: round-robin turns, but any agent can No-op to let others act.

#### 3. Shared Task & Loss
- **Success Predicate**: At least one agent reaches goal without entering trap  
- **Loss L(τ)**: Total steps taken by all agents until success (or 200 if failed)  
  → Lower = better collective performance  

#### 4. Key Scenario: "The Sacrifice Play"
Expected dynamics in a good run:  
- Greedy + Explorer both head toward the short tempting Path B  
- Sacrificer probes ahead, enters trap, dies, issues Prune on entire Path B  
- Greedy/Explorer respect prune → reroute to long safe Path A  
- Goal reached in ~60 steps (instead of wasting time or dying)  

→ Sacrificer has zero individual progress but **huge positive marginal contribution** (prevents ~100 wasted steps or failure)  
→ This is the smoking-gun case where Equal Split and Action-Count completely fail, but LUMEN should reward Sacrificer highly.

#### 5. LUMEN Protocol Implementation (Simplified for Phase 1)
- **Ledger**: Simple Python list of dicts (later → JSON file or blockchain sim)  
- **Counterfactual Baselines ℬ**: Use **Masked Agent Rollouts only**  
  → For each agent i: take its actual policy, but in counterfactual rollouts randomly replace 40% of its actions with uniform random valid moves  
  → Sample 100 rollouts per agent → compute expected L with i masked vs actual L  
- **Γ_i**: Start at 1.0, reduced only if challenge successfully proves part of trajectory non-replayable (keep simple)  
- **Challenge Phase**: Manual/scripted for Phase 1  
  → One agent always challenges if claimed ΔL > threshold  
  → Challenge succeeds if it provides a baseline rollout with lower loss  

#### 6. Metrics & Success Criteria (Concrete Thresholds)
Run 50 seeded episodes:

1. **Core Win Condition**:  
   LUMEN mean task loss ≤ 85% of Equal Split loss (i.e., ≥15% reduction)

2. **Incentive Alignment**:  
   Sacrificer/Pruner receives highest median \hat{C}_i despite lowest individual steps/progress

3. **Stability**:  
   Std dev of \hat{C}_i across seeds ≤ 20% of mean \hat{C}_i

4. **Overhead**:  
   Report average # rollouts needed (target <200 per agent for convergence)

5. **Challenge Effectiveness**:  
   At least 70% of inflated claims (manually injected bad claims) are successfully challenged

If all 5 pass → Phase 1 success. If not → pivot or refine.

#### 7. Why This is Optimal
- **Minimal code**: Gymnasium custom env ~200 lines, agents ~50 lines each, credit calc ~100 lines  
- **One episode tells the story**: The Sacrifice Play is visually obvious – you can literally plot the trajectories and see pruning save the day  
- **All mechanisms stressed**: Pruning value, counterfactual marginals, partial obs, heterogeneity, challenge potential  
- **Falsifiable fast**: 50 runs finish in minutes on laptop  
- **Extensible later**: Add real RL agents, dynamic grids, baseline providers, on-chain logging
