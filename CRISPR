PhD Research Proposal

Title

A Multi-LLM Grounded Scientific Reasoning Framework for Predicting CRISPR DNA Repair Outcomes


---

1. Introduction and Background

The rapid evolution of genome editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has transformed molecular biology and therapeutic research. While CRISPR enables programmable DNA cleavage at specific genomic loci, the subsequent DNA repair process—primarily through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR)—remains probabilistic and difficult to predict.

Unpredictable repair outcomes limit the safety and precision of therapeutic genome editing applications. Although computational models such as inDelphi, FORECasT, and related deep learning approaches have attempted to model repair distributions, generalization across cell types and genomic contexts remains incomplete.

Simultaneously, large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT systems, Anthropic’s Claude models, and xAI’s Grok demonstrate strong capabilities in reasoning, literature synthesis, and code generation. However, these systems lack structured scientific grounding and reproducible validation pipelines.

This proposal aims to integrate biological sequence modeling with a multi-LLM reasoning and verification architecture to improve both predictive performance and scientific reliability in CRISPR DNA repair modeling.


---

2. Problem Statement

Despite advances in CRISPR editing, three central challenges persist:

1. DNA repair outcomes after CRISPR cleavage remain difficult to predict with high reliability.


2. Existing machine learning models often lack interpretability and cross-context generalization.


3. LLM-based scientific assistance systems lack formal validation and reproducibility mechanisms.



There is currently no unified framework integrating:

sequence-based DNA repair modeling,

retrieval-grounded scientific reasoning,

and multi-model AI verification.



---

3. Research Objectives

The objectives of this doctoral research are:

1. To design and implement a transformer-based sequence model capable of predicting CRISPR DNA repair outcomes from local genomic context.


2. To construct a retrieval-augmented, evidence-grounded reasoning layer using multiple large language models.


3. To develop a verification and reproducibility framework ensuring that generated predictions and explanations are scientifically validated.


4. To evaluate whether multi-LLM orchestration improves robustness and interpretability compared to single-model systems.




---

4. Research Questions

The central research question is:

Can a multi-LLM, retrieval-grounded scientific reasoning architecture improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and reliability in CRISPR DNA repair outcome modeling compared to existing single-model approaches?

Sub-questions include:

How strongly does local DNA sequence context determine repair outcome distributions?

Can transformer architectures outperform current statistical and CNN-based baselines?

Does cross-model reasoning reduce hallucination and improve scientific grounding?

Can interpretability mechanisms identify biologically meaningful repair determinants?



---

5. Hypotheses

H1: DNA repair outcomes after CRISPR cleavage are largely determined by local sequence context and microhomology patterns.

H2: Transformer-based sequence models can capture repair distribution patterns more accurately than existing baseline models.

H3: A coordinated multi-LLM architecture with retrieval and verification reduces factual error and increases reproducibility compared to single LLM pipelines.


---

6. Literature Context

Prior work in CRISPR repair modeling has demonstrated that sequence features influence indel distributions. Deep learning approaches have shown improvements over logistic regression models but suffer from limited interpretability and dataset heterogeneity.

Parallel research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated that grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge sources improves reliability. However, such systems have not been systematically applied to biological modeling pipelines.

This research bridges computational genomics and AI reasoning systems.
