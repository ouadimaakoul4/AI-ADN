# GLOBAL ASTEROID DEFENSE INFRASTRUCTURE (GADI)

**Version 3.0 – Final Ratification Protocol**

---

## PREAMBLE: THE INSURANCE PRINCIPLE

We, the undersigned capable entities, recognize:

1. **The Threat**: A large near-Earth object impact represents a preventable, civilization-level catastrophe.
2. **The Gap**: Current frameworks provide warning and planning, but lack guaranteed response when deflection windows are narrow.
3. **The Solution**: Pre-committed insurance, not emergency authority.

Therefore, we establish this Infrastructure as a binding mutual assurance contract—not a governing body—to automate coordinated deflection when specific physical conditions are met.

---

## ARTICLE I: SCOPE & LOCK

### 1.1 Included Threat

- **Object**: Natural near-Earth objects (asteroids/comets)
- **Size**: ≥ 150 meters in effective diameter
- **Threshold**: Palermo Impact Hazard Scale ≥ -2.0
- **Deflection Feasibility**: Computationally confirmed ΔV < 2 km/s for kinetic deflection
- **Warning Time**: Any timeframe from detection to potential impact

### 1.2 Explicit Exclusions

This protocol does not address:

- Climate change or ecological crises
- Pandemics or biological threats
- Artificial intelligence governance
- Warfare or interstate conflict
- Economic or social collapse
- Space debris or defunct satellites
- Intentionally redirected objects (acts of war)

**Lock Mechanism**: Any expansion of scope requires complete protocol sunset and re-ratification under new agreement with unanimous consent of all then-current Core Participants.

---

## ARTICLE II: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 The Three-Layer Model

#### A. VERIFICATION LAYER

**Composition**: Minimum 4 independent sensor networks (increased from 3 for redundancy)

- Space-based infrared (e.g., NEOSM, Sentinel)
- Ground-based radar (e.g., Goldstone, upgraded Arecibo replacement)
- Optical survey (e.g., Vera Rubin, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS)
- International backup network (ESA/JAXA/CNSA combined assets)

**Trigger Product**: Machine-Readable Threat Certificate (MRTC)

**Signature Requirement**: 3 of 4 networks must cryptographically sign identical threat parameters meeting Article I thresholds within 72 hours of each other

**False Positive Protection**: Any single network may issue a 48-hour challenge flag requiring re-verification

#### B. COMMITMENT LAYER

**Core Instrument**: Pre-Commitment Protocol (PCP)

**Format**: Machine-readable, legally binding contract with smart contract automation where possible

**Stored**: Distributed ledger with triple-redundant neutral trustee escrow across three jurisdictions (Switzerland, Singapore, New Zealand)

**Transparency**: All commitments publicly auditable; actual asset locations classified until Phase 2 activation

#### C. EXECUTION LAYER

**Mission Authority Nodes (MANs)**: Time-limited technical coordination teams with sunset provisions

**Execution Scripts**: Pre-validated mission sequences with annual review and update

**Sovereign Interface**: Triple-key release mechanisms (technical lead + political authority + neutral arbiter)

**Backup Provision**: If government entities fail to execute in Phase 2, pre-committed commercial participants automatically activate using forfeited bonds

---

## ARTICLE III: PHASED ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 0: Standby

- **Condition**: No valid MRTC exists
- **State**: Assets under sovereign control
- **Activity**: Biannual tabletop exercises, annual protocol reviews, quarterly verification layer tests

### Phase 1: Verification & Reconnaissance (Automated)

**Trigger**: Valid MRTC issued

**Automatic Actions**:
1. Recon MAN activates (within 24 hours)
2. Pre-committed observation assets prioritize threat (within 48 hours)
3. Rapid-response launch window reserved (≤ 90 days for reconnaissance)
4. Flyby/rendezvous mission launched
5. Public notification issued via standardized template (transparency requirement)

**Duration**: 60-180 days depending on object characteristics

**Bond Status**: Phase 1 bonds locked ($250M equivalent per Core Participant)

**Defection Option**: Any participant may exit with 50% bond forfeiture until reconnaissance data is delivered

### Phase 2: Deflection Decision (Sovereign Choice with Backstop)

**Trigger**: Recon data delivered with refined parameters and mission recommendations

**Required Action**: Each Core Participant delivers formal go/no-go within 30 days

**Decision Threshold**: 75% of Core Participants (by bond value) must vote "Go" for deflection to proceed

**Consequences of "Go" Vote**:
- Phase 2 bonds locked ($6B equivalent per Core Participant)
- Deflection MAN activates
- Asset release sequences initiated
- Voting participant gains full data access and mission input

**Consequences of "No-Go" Vote (Minority)**:
- Phase 1 bond forfeited
- Public notification of defection with rationale (if provided)
- Exclusion from mission decision-making (but not future protocols)
- Option to rejoin Phase 2 within 15 days at 150% bond rate

**Consequences of "No-Go" Vote (Majority - Mission Cancellation)**:
- All Phase 1 bonds returned
- Independent scientific review commissioned
- Protocol review triggered within 6 months
- No penalties if scientific consensus supports cancellation

**Commercial Backstop**: If <75% Core Participant consensus achieved but ≥2 Commercial Participants vote "Go", commercial mission may proceed using pooled forfeited bonds plus private capital

### Phase 3: Deflection Execution

**Duration**: As required by mission profile (typically 1-5 years)

**Authority**: Deflection MAN (technical coordination only, no sovereign powers)

**Composition**: 
- Technical lead (rotating between Core Participants annually)
- Deputy leads from top 3 contributing entities
- Independent safety officer
- Public liaison officer

**Oversight**: Quarterly public progress reports; monthly classified briefings to Core Participants

**Completion Criteria**: Object no longer poses Palermo Scale ≥ -2.0 threat OR object impact confirmed avoided OR mission declared unsuccessful

**Contingency**: If primary deflection attempt fails with >6 months warning remaining, automatic Phase 2 reset with new mission profile vote

### Phase 4: Sunset & Assessment

**Within 90 days of mission completion**:
1. MAN dissolves, all temporary authority keys cryptographically destroyed with public verification
2. Remaining bonds returned to participants
3. All mission data declassified (2-year embargo for peer review, down from 5)
4. Comprehensive after-action report published
5. Independent success/failure assessment by scientific panel

**Protocol Review**: Entire GADI framework automatically sunsets 12 years after ratification (extended from 10) unless explicitly renewed by ≥75% Core Participant vote

**Lessons Integration**: After-action findings must be incorporated into protocol updates or ratification fails

```
INPUT: warning_time, diameter, porosity, rotation_rate, composition_certainty

IF warning_time < 2 years:
    IF diameter > 500m:
        PROFILE = DELTA (multi-stage)
    ELSE IF composition_certainty < 60%:
        PROFILE = DELTA (fast-track)
    ELSE:
        PROFILE = BETA (nuclear standoff)
        
ELSE IF warning_time >= 2 years AND warning_time < 5 years:
    IF porosity > 50% OR composition = rubble_pile:
        PROFILE = BETA (nuclear standoff)
    ELSE:
        PROFILE = ALPHA (kinetic) with BETA backup prepared
        
ELSE IF warning_time >= 5 years AND warning_time < 10 years:
    IF rotation_rate > 2 rpm OR irregular_shape:
        PRIMARY = ALPHA (kinetic)
        BACKUP = GAMMA (ion beam)
    ELSE:

## FINAL STATEMENT

This document represents humanity's commitment to collective survival through intelligent pre-coordination. We prove here that international cooperation need not require permanent institutions, surrendered sovereignty, or trust in distant authorities.

Instead, we demonstrate that:
- **Automation** can replace real-time negotiation when conditions are clear
- **Pre-commitment** can overcome coordination failures without creating new risks
- **Transparency** builds legitimacy without compromising operational security
- **Sunset clauses** prevent temporary measures from becoming permanent power
- **Financial enforcement** aligns incentives where treaties alone fail

The Global Asteroid Defense Infrastructure is narrowly scoped, heavily automated, and deliberately temporary. It is insurance, not governance.

If successful, this architecture may inform—but does not prescribe—approaches to other existential risks. Each threat requires its own carefully tailored framework.

But first, we must prove we can deflect a rock.

And in doing so, prove we can coordinate to save ourselves.
