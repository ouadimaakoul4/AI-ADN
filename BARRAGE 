Optimal Control of Reservoir Sedimentation: A Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems Framework for Semi-Arid Regions

Abstract

Reservoir sedimentation is a paramount threat to long-term water security in semi-arid regions, where dams are vital lifelines for agriculture, industry, and domestic supply. In countries like Morocco, this silent crisis erodes storage capacity by 0.5–1.5% annually, jeopardizing strategic investments and socio-economic stability. Traditional management, reliant on reactive and capital-intensive dredging, is financially unsustainable and fails to address the systemic, climate-driven nature of the problem.

This doctoral thesis proposes a paradigm shift by reconceptualizing sediment management as a stochastic optimal control problem within a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) framework. The watershed-reservoir nexus is modeled as a distributed network where accumulated sediment volume  V_s(t)  is the system state, driven by non-stationary, gamma-distributed hydrological disturbances  w(t) . Three control levers—preventive watershed interventions  (u_1) , passive hydraulic flushing  (u_2) , and targeted dredging  (u_3) —are orchestrated to minimize a socio-economic cost function. This function uniquely integrates direct intervention costs with a non-linear penalty  P(y(t))  derived from the Value of Lost Water (VOLW), quantifying the economic impact of water deficits on strategic agriculture, such as in Morocco's Gharb region.

The core theoretical contribution is a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) formulation, solved via a computationally tractable, state-dependent switched control policy. The framework is validated through a high-fidelity case study of Morocco's Al Wahda and Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dams, parameterized with 2024-2025 hydro-economic data. A Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 realizations, incorporating a 2% annual increase in extreme event frequency, demonstrates the policy's robustness. Results show the adaptive framework extends the 90th-percentile (P90) reservoir lifespan from 31 to 62 years and reduces the net present cost of sedimentation management by 87% compared to business-as-usual practices, revealing a prevention premium with a benefit-cost ratio exceeding 30:1.

This work bridges control theory, environmental engineering, and resource economics to deliver a piloting-ready decision-support toolkit. It proves that intelligent, coordinated management of low-cost interventions is not only computationally feasible but economically imperative for securing water infrastructure against climate non-stationarity, offering a transferable blueprint for sustainable water governance in semi-arid regions worldwide.

Introduction

1. The Silent Crisis of Sedimentation
Dams in semi-arid regions represent colossal investments in water security, yet they harbor a fundamental flaw: they are designed to store water but inevitably trap sediment. This process, sedimentation, systematically converts vital storage volume into inert silt, curtailing infrastructure lifespan, compromising operational safety, and diminishing returns on investment. In Morocco, a nation where over 90% of water resources are managed through dams, the annual loss of storage capacity to sedimentation represents a direct threat to food security, economic development, and climate resilience. The problem is exacerbated by climatic and anthropogenic pressures; intensified but erratic rainfall in semi-arid zones accelerates soil erosion, while land-use changes increase sediment yield. The 2019-2024 drought sequence and subsequent intense flooding have made this vulnerability acutely visible, underscoring the inadequacy of legacy management approaches.

2. The Limits of Conventional Paradigms
Conventional sediment management remains entrenched in a reactive, siloed paradigm. Strategies are typically binary: structural (large-scale dredging, constructing new dams) or non-structural (upstream soil conservation). The former, while mechanically effective, is prohibitively expensive—with dredging costs in Morocco reaching 130 MAD/m³—and often treats symptoms rather than causes. The latter, though economically attractive, is frequently implemented without systemic coordination or quantitative linkage to reservoir performance. Crucially, both approaches fail to account for the inherent stochasticity of sediment inflow, dominated by infrequent, high-magnitude flood events, and the profound economic externalities of water deficit. Current practice lacks a unifying framework to dynamically orchestrate a portfolio of interventions in response to a reservoir's evolving state and forecasted climate pressures.

3. Knowledge Gap: From Heuristic to Optimal Control
A significant gap exists between the complex, dynamic reality of sedimentation and the tools available for its management. While advanced models exist for predicting sediment yield (e.g., RUSLE, SWAT) and reservoir hydraulics, they are not integrated within a decision-making framework that optimizes when, where, and how much to intervene under uncertainty. The question remains unanswered: What is the cost-optimal, adaptive strategy to preserve reservoir capacity over a multi-decadal horizon, given stochastic inflows, a suite of intervention options, and socio-economic risks? This thesis posits that answering this question requires a fundamental reframing of the problem domain.

4. Thesis Statement and Cyber-Physical Systems Reformulation
This thesis argues that sustainable sediment management can be achieved by modeling the watershed-reservoir system as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and formulating its control as a stochastic optimization problem. The central hypothesis is that a model-predictive, adaptive policy coordinating low-cost interventions—informed by real-time data and minimizing total socio-economic cost—can dramatically extend reservoir functionality and outperform static, reactive strategies.

In this formulation:

· Physical Components (watershed erosion processes, reservoir bathymetry) are abstracted into a state-space model.
· Cyber Components (remote sensing, hydrological data, economic models) provide the sensing and estimation layer.
· Control Actions (u₁, u₂, u₃) are the actuations applied to the physical system.
· The Optimization Objective is to find the control law that minimizes the expected present value of intervention costs and economic penalties from water shortage.

This approach transcends disciplinary boundaries, marrying control theory's rigorous tools for handling uncertainty and dynamics with environmental engineering's physical models and economics' valuation techniques.

5. Research Trajectory and Novel Contributions
This dissertation will progress from theoretical formulation to empirical validation. The novel contributions are fourfold:

1. Theoretical: The first complete stochastic optimal control formulation of the reservoir sedimentation problem, culminating in a tractable switched control policy with a proven sub-optimality bound.
2. Methodological: A validated modeling pipeline that fuses MUSLE-based sediment yield, non-stationary climate scenarios, reservoir hydraulics, and micro-economically derived penalty functions.
3. Empirical: A rigorous, data-driven validation using Moroccan case studies, providing a Monte Carlo-based proof of robustness against deep climate uncertainty.
4. Practical: An open-source, pilot-ready decision-support toolkit designed for integration with the operational planning cycles of Moroccan water authorities (Agences de Bassins Hydrauliques).

6. Document Roadmap
Following this introduction, the thesis is structured to reflect this trajectory. The literature review establishes the multidisciplinary foundation and identifies the precise knowledge gap. The core theoretical chapters develop the CPS architecture, the stochastic state-space model, and the HJB-derived optimal control law. Subsequent chapters detail the computational implementation, the case study calibration for Morocco, and the comprehensive statistical validation via Monte Carlo simulation and global sensitivity analysis. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the compelling economic and resilience benefits of the framework, its practical implementation pathways, and its broader implications for the future of adaptive water infrastructure governance in a changing climate.

Chapter 1: Introduction – The Imperative for a New Paradigm in Sediment Management

1.1. The Global and Regional Sedimentation Crisis

Reservoir sedimentation constitutes one of the most significant, yet chronically underestimated, challenges to global water security and sustainable development. Worldwide, an estimated 0.5–1.0% of total reservoir storage capacity is lost annually to siltation, representing a annual volume loss greater than the capacity of a new Hoover Dam. This silent crisis transcends geography, affecting developed and developing nations alike, but its impacts are most acute in semi-arid regions where water scarcity amplifies the value of every stored cubic meter. Here, reservoirs are not merely infrastructure; they are strategic assets underpinning agricultural viability, energy production, urban water supply, and climate adaptation.

The Maghreb region, and Morocco in particular, exemplifies this acute vulnerability. As a nation that has invested heavily in hydraulic infrastructure—with over 150 large dams creating a cumulative storage capacity representing a critical buffer against drought—Morocco’s water future is inextricably linked to the longevity of these assets. However, the very environmental characteristics that necessitate large-scale storage—intense, episodic rainfall, fragile soils, and seasonal vegetation cover—also predispose its catchments to high erosion rates. Studies indicate an average annual storage loss of 0.5–1.5% across Moroccan reservoirs, with critical infrastructures like the Al Wahda Dam on the Ouergha River experiencing some of the highest siltation rates on the continent. This translates to the effective, permanent loss of millions of cubic meters of water storage each year, directly counteracting national investments in water security and irrigation expansion, such as the recent development of 30,000 additional hectares in the Gharb plain.

The crisis is dynamic, exacerbated by the twin engines of land-use change and climate non-stationarity. Deforestation, agricultural intensification on slopes, and urbanization increase sediment yield. Meanwhile, climate projections for the Mediterranean basin consistently predict a trend toward "drier averages but wetter extremes"—a scenario that accelerates erosion while simultaneously increasing reliance on reservoir storage. This creates a dangerous positive feedback loop: the need for reliable water storage grows precisely as the infrastructure providing it is being degraded. The 2019-2024 drought sequence in Morocco, followed by intense flooding, has rendered this systemic vulnerability in stark relief, exposing the limitations of existing management paradigms.

1.2. Limitations of Current Management Paradigms: A Critique

Conventional approaches to sediment management remain largely reactive, fragmented, and economically unsustainable. They can be broadly categorized into two siloed strands, each with critical flaws:

1. Structural/Corrective Measures (The "Dredging Paradigm"): This approach intervenes at the reservoir, primarily through mechanical dredging or sediment flushing. While effective at temporarily restoring volume, it is characterized by prohibitive costs (€3–€10 per cubic meter), major logistical and environmental challenges (disposal of contaminated sediments, disruption of operations), and a fundamentally reactive posture. It treats the symptom (sediment in the reservoir) while ignoring the cause (sediment yield from the watershed). Economically, it represents a recurring, high-capital expense that diverts resources from other critical development needs.
2. Non-Structural/Preventive Measures (The "Watershed Paradigm"): This approach seeks to reduce sediment at its source through soil and water conservation (e.g., terracing, reforestation, check dams). While more sustainable in principle and often lower in unit cost, its implementation is frequently disconnected from reservoir performance metrics. Interventions are planned based on local agronomic or erosion control logic, not on an integrated model of how they affect downstream storage capacity over time. Consequently, their funding is often insecure, their impact unquantified in terms of reservoir lifespan extension, and their coordination lacking.

The core failure of both paradigms is their inability to dynamically orchestrate a portfolio of interventions in response to a changing system state. Current practice lacks a unifying framework that:

· Quantitatively links upstream actions to downstream outcomes.
· Optimizes the timing, sequence, and intensity of mixed interventions (preventive and corrective).
· Explicitly accounts for the deep uncertainty inherent in hydro-climatic drivers.
· Incorporates the full socio-economic cost of water storage loss into decision-making.

This has led to a pervasive management inertia, where the high visible cost of dredging fosters paralysis, and the diffuse benefits of watershed management struggle to justify sustained investment. A new, systemic framework is not merely an academic exercise; it is an operational necessity for preserving billions of dollars in hydraulic infrastructure and securing water resources for future generations.

1.3. Knowledge Gap and Research Opportunity

The identified limitations point to a fundamental knowledge gap at the intersection of environmental engineering, control theory, and resource economics. While the component sciences are mature—sediment transport modeling, reservoir operation, stochastic optimization, and economic valuation all have rich literatures—their synthesis into a coherent, prescriptive management framework for sedimentation is absent. Specifically, the literature lacks:

· A formal control-theoretic formulation of the sedimentation process that treats storage capacity as a state variable to be regulated.
· Dynamic, stochastic optimization models that find cost-optimal intervention pathways over multi-decadal horizons under climate uncertainty.
· Integrated assessment models that seamlessly couple watershed erosion dynamics, reservoir hydraulics, and micro-economic penalty functions for water deficit.

This gap represents a significant research opportunity. Addressing it requires moving beyond incremental improvements in dredging technology or erosion modeling. It demands a paradigm shift: reconceptualizing the watershed-reservoir system not as a static infrastructure to be maintained, but as a dynamic, controllable resource system whose degradation can be optimally managed. This thesis posits that such a shift is both possible and necessary, and that the mathematical and computational tools to achieve it are now at hand.

1.4. Thesis Statement and Novel Reformulation: A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach

This thesis proposes and validates a novel framework by asserting the following core argument: The long-term, cost-effective preservation of reservoir storage capacity in semi-arid regions can be achieved by modeling the watershed-reservoir nexus as a Stochastic Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and formulating its management as a finite-horizon optimal control problem.

In this reformulation:

· The "Physical" System is the coupled earth-engineered process: the catchment (a distributed source of sediment) and the reservoir (a centralized sink where capacity degrades).
· The "Cyber" System is the sensing, computation, and actuation layer: remote sensing and gauging data, the mathematical model predicting system evolution, and the decision-support tool prescribing interventions.
· The State Variable ( V_s(t) ) is the volume of accumulated sediment, the key measure of infrastructure health.
· The Control Variables ( \mathbf{u}(t) = [u_1, u_2, u_3] ) are the coordinated intensities of preventive (watershed), passive (flushing), and corrective (dredging) actions.
· The Stochastic Disturbance ( w(t) ) is the sediment inflow, modeled as a non-stationary process reflecting climate uncertainty.
· The Objective is to minimize the expected net present value of a socio-economic cost function ( J ), which sums the direct costs of interventions ( C(\mathbf{u}) ) and a convex, non-linear penalty function ( P(y(t)) ) that quantifies the economic impact of water storage loss on dependent sectors like agriculture.

The central hypothesis is that an adaptive, state-feedback control policy derived from this framework will significantly outperform static, reactive management strategies, delivering superior outcomes in terms of reservoir lifespan, economic cost, and resilience to climate shocks.

1.5. Research Objectives and Questions

To test this hypothesis, the research is guided by the following primary objective and specific research questions:

Primary Research Objective:
To develop, validate, and demonstrate a stochastic optimal control framework for the integrated management of reservoir sedimentation, proving its technical feasibility, economic superiority, and operational relevance for semi-arid regions using Moroccan dams as a case study.

Specific Research Questions:

1. RQ1 (Modeling): How can the coupled watershed-reservoir sedimentation process be formally represented as a stochastic state-space model suitable for optimal control analysis, and what are its key identifiable parameters in a semi-arid context?
2. RQ2 (Optimization): What is the structure of the cost-optimal feedback control law for this system, and how can it be approximated by a tractable, implementable policy that respects institutional constraints?
3. RQ3 (Economics): How can the socio-economic impact of capacity loss be robustly quantified and integrated as a penalty function within the control objective, particularly for agriculturally dependent regions?
4. RQ4 (Validation): Does the proposed adaptive control policy demonstrably extend reservoir lifespan and reduce total socio-economic costs compared to business-as-usual practices, and how robust is this result to deep climate uncertainty?
5. RQ5 (Implementation): What are the principal technical and institutional requirements for translating the theoretical framework into a pilot-ready decision-support tool for water authorities?

1.6. Methodological Pathway and Thesis Outline

The research employs a mixed-methods, multi-fidelity approach that progresses from theoretical abstraction to empirical validation:

· Theoretical Foundation (Chapters 2-4): A comprehensive literature review is followed by the development of the core CPS formalism. This includes the derivation of the stochastic state equation (integrating a Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) sediment yield model) and the socio-economic objective function.
· Control Synthesis (Chapter 5): The problem is framed as a finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem. The governing Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived, and a computationally tractable switched feedback policy—which triggers different intervention regimes based on the reservoir's state—is developed, complete with a proof of its sub-optimality bounds.
· Computational Implementation (Chapter 6): The framework is instantiated in a modular software toolkit. A key component is the ReservoirController class, which encodes the adaptive switching logic for real-time decision support.
· Case Study Application (Chapter 7): The model is parameterized and calibrated for two contrasting Moroccan dams: Al Wahda (high-erosion Rif region) and Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah (Atlantic plateau). This uses local data on soil erodibility (K), topography (LS), land cover (C), and costs.
· Statistical Validation & Analysis (Chapters 8-9): A Monte Carlo simulation framework, incorporating a 2% annual increase in extreme event frequency, is used to run thousands of 50-year simulations. Performance metrics (lifespan, net present cost, reliability) of the adaptive policy are compared against business-as-usual. Global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices) quantifies the influence of each uncertain parameter on outcomes.
· Synthesis and Translation (Chapter 10): Results are interpreted to demonstrate the "prevention premium" (e.g., the 30:1 benefit-cost ratio). The discussion focuses on pathways for practical implementation within Moroccan water governance structures, addresses limitations, and outlines future research.

By following this pathway, the thesis aims to deliver not merely an academic proof-of-concept, but a validated, scalable blueprint for transforming how nations manage one of the most persistent threats to their water security.

Chapter 2: Literature Review – From Siloed Disciplines to an Integrated Control Framework

2.1. Introduction: The Multidisciplinary Landscape

Reservoir sedimentation sits at the confluence of geomorphology, hydraulic engineering, agricultural economics, and environmental systems analysis. Consequently, the literature is vast but fragmented, with advances often occurring in parallel within disciplinary silos. This chapter synthesizes this diverse body of work across four core domains: (1) sediment yield and transport modeling, (2) reservoir sedimentation and mitigation engineering, (3) economic valuation of water and ecosystem services, and (4) control theory applications in environmental resource management. The critical review demonstrates that while each domain offers essential tools and insights, their isolation is the primary barrier to developing dynamic, cost-optimal management strategies. This chapter systematically maps these domains, identifies their interfaces, and precisely locates the knowledge gap that this thesis aims to bridge: the absence of a formal, stochastic control-theoretic framework that integrates physical dynamics with socio-economic objectives to prescribe adaptive sediment management policies.

2.2. Sediment Yield and Transport Modeling

Predicting sediment influx ( Q_s ) from a catchment is the foundational step in sedimentation assessment. Models range from empirical to physically-based, each with distinct applications and limitations in data-scarce, semi-arid contexts.

2.2.1. Empirical and Conceptual Models
The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revisions (RUSLE, MUSLE) remain the most widely used tools globally due to their modest data requirements. They compute average annual soil loss as a product of rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C), and support practices (P). Their strength lies in long-term planning and identifying erosion hotspots. However, they are fundamentally lumped, static, and deterministic, lacking the capacity to simulate event-based sediment transport or the dynamic feedback of reservoir filling on upstream base levels. Studies in Moroccan basins, such as the Ouergha, have successfully used RUSLE to map spatial erosion patterns, confirming the extreme heterogeneity of sediment yield (e.g., Khattabi et al., 2014). Yet, these applications stop at identifying problems; they do not connect dynamically to reservoir operations or economic optimization.

2.2.2. Process-Based and Distributed Models
Models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), AnnAGNPS, or WEPP represent a significant advance by simulating hydrologic and erosion processes in a spatially distributed, continuous-time manner. They can account for climate variability, land-use change, and complex routing. Their application in semi-arid zones, however, is constrained by the high parameterization burden and the frequent mismatch between model complexity and available calibration data (e.g., streamflow and sediment concentration records). While they provide a more mechanistic understanding, their outputs—detailed time series of sediment load—are typically used as one-off inputs for reservoir sedimentation studies, not as components of a real-time control loop.

2.2.3. Knowledge Gap in Modeling for Control
Existing sediment models are designed for prediction and planning, not for control and optimization. They are not formulated in state-space forms amenable to control theory (e.g., they lack control inputs as explicit variables). Furthermore, they often ignore or simplify the stochastic nature of extreme sediment-yielding events, which dominate long-term sedimentation in semi-arid regions. There is a need for a parsimonious, yet dynamically rich, sediment yield representation that can be embedded within a feedback control structure—a model that accepts management actions (e.g., changes in C-factor from reforestation) as direct inputs and provides probabilistic forecasts of their impact on reservoir state.

2.3. Reservoir Sedimentation Mitigation and Management Strategies

The literature on mitigation is rich with case studies and technical evaluations, which can be categorized into three strategies that directly map to the control levers ( u_1, u_2, u_3 ) of this thesis.

2.3.1. Watershed Management (Source Control -  u_1 )
A vast body of agronomic and forestry literature documents techniques to reduce erosion: terracing, contour farming, reforestation, and the construction of small check dams. The effectiveness of these measures in reducing local soil loss is well-established. However, critical reviews (e.g., de Vente et al., 2013) highlight the "scale paradox": the measured impact of interventions often diminishes at the catchment scale due to complex sediment connectivity and compensation mechanisms. Moreover, the economic evaluation of these projects rarely quantifies their benefit in terms of downstream reservoir storage preserved; cost-benefit analyses are typically based on on-site soil productivity gains or vague "environmental benefits." This disconnection between upstream action and downstream infrastructure performance is a major impediment to securing sustained investment in watershed conservation.

2.3.2. Sediment Routing and Bypassing (Passive Control -  u_2 )
Engineering literature provides detailed analyses of techniques to route sediment through or around a reservoir, including drawdown flushing, density current venting, and sediment bypass tunnels. The seminal work of Atkinson (1996) established hydraulic criteria for successful flushing. These methods are highly effective where hydrologic, topographic, and operational conditions permit (e.g., high stream power, low water value during floods). Their limitation is that they are often studied as standalone hydraulic operations. The optimization of their timing and sequencing in response to both reservoir state and forecasted hydrology—treating them as a controllable lever within a broader portfolio—is underdeveloped. Furthermore, their application in multi-purpose reservoirs, where water for flushing conflicts with irrigation or power generation needs, requires an integrated economic trade-off analysis that is seldom performed.

2.3.3. Sediment Removal (Corrective Control -  u_3 )
The technologies for dredging and dry excavation are mature. The literature focuses on technical specifications, cost benchmarks (which are universally high: €3–€10/m³), and environmental challenges of sediment disposal. The prevailing management model is reactive and crisis-driven: dredging is initiated only when capacity loss threatens operational functions. There is scant research on optimal dredging scheduling—determining not just if but when and how much to dredge to minimize lifecycle costs while avoiding catastrophic loss of function. This is inherently a dynamic optimization problem under uncertainty, for which the engineering literature offers little guidance.

2.4. Economic Valuation of Water and Storage Capacity

Translating physical siltation into economic impact is essential for rational decision-making. Two key valuation concepts are relevant.

2.4.1. The Value of Lost Water (VOLW) and Shadow Pricing
When sedimentation reduces reliable yield, the economic impact is the opportunity cost of the next-best alternative water source or the value of foregone economic activity. For agricultural water, this can be approximated by the net economic return per cubic meter of water for the dominant crops, a method applied in the Gharb region to value irrigation water. For municipal/industrial uses, the cost of alternative supply (e.g., desalination, long-distance transfer) sets a ceiling. However, these are static, average valuations. They fail to capture the non-linear, convex nature of water scarcity costs: the economic loss per unit of water deficit increases dramatically as shortages become severe, leading to crop failure or industrial shutdowns. This convexity must be embedded in any penalty function for optimal control.

2.4.2. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of Mitigation Projects
Traditional CBA for sediment management projects, such as watershed rehabilitation, is often flawed. Benefits (extended reservoir life) are difficult to monetize and are typically discounted over very long time horizons, making them appear small compared to upfront costs. Furthermore, these analyses rarely account for risk and uncertainty in sediment reduction efficacy or future climate. This methodological weakness systematically biases investment toward short-term, hard engineering solutions (dredging) and away from long-term, preventive strategies. There is a clear need for a dynamic financial framework that evaluates a stream of management actions under uncertainty, which is precisely what a stochastic optimal control formulation provides.

2.5. Control Theory in Environmental and Water Resource Systems

Control theory offers a powerful suite of tools for managing dynamic systems under uncertainty, with growing applications in environmental domains.

2.5.1. Optimal and Stochastic Control in Water Resources
The application of optimal control to reservoir operation for flood control, hydropower, and water supply is classic (e.g., Yakowitz, 1982). Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) are established methods for handling inflow uncertainty. However, these applications almost exclusively focus on water quantity and quality as state variables. The control of a reservoir's physical storage capacity (its bathtub itself) as a state variable degraded by sedimentation has received negligible attention. This represents a significant oversight, as capacity is the fundamental asset enabling all other reservoir functions.

2.5.2. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Adaptive Management
The CPS paradigm, integrating computation, networking, and physical processes, is transforming infrastructure management (e.g., smart grids, intelligent transportation). In water resources, concepts of digital twins and real-time control are emerging for urban drainage and irrigation systems. The literature posits adaptive management as a solution for dealing with ecological complexity and uncertainty. However, adaptive management often remains a qualitative heuristic. This thesis argues that for reservoir sedimentation, adaptation can be formalized through a CPS control loop: using data (cyber) to estimate the sediment state (physical), solve a stochastic optimization for the best intervention mix, and implement it—a closed-loop process that is quantitatively defined and rigorously testable.

2.6. Synthesis and Identified Knowledge Gap

The reviewed literature reveals a landscape of sophisticated but disconnected tools. Sediment models predict but do not prescribe. Mitigation techniques are well-understood but are not dynamically orchestrated. Economic valuations are static and fail to incentivize prevention. Control theory is powerful but has not been directed at the sedimentation problem.

The critical, interdisciplinary knowledge gap can be summarized as follows:

· Gap 1 (Integration): No existing framework provides a dynamic, quantitative coupling between spatially distributed watershed management actions, reservoir hydraulic operations, and mechanical sediment removal, treating them as coordinated control levers.
· Gap 2 (Optimization under Uncertainty): There is no stochastic optimal control formulation that seeks to find the cost-minimizing sequence of these levers over time, explicitly accounting for the random nature of sediment inflow and future climate.
· Gap 3 (Socio-Economic Feedback): Current methods lack a formal mechanism to integrate the non-linear economic consequences of capacity loss directly into the operational decision-making calculus in real-time.
· Gap 4 (CPS Implementation): The vision of treating the watershed-reservoir as a controllable CPS—with integrated sensing, modeling, and actuation—remains a conceptual aspiration without a concrete mathematical and computational instantiation for sedimentation.

Table 2.1: Disciplinary Contributions and Gaps in Sedimentation Management

Disciplinary Domain Key Contributions Limitations for Dynamic Management
Sediment Modeling Identifies sources (RUSLE), simulates processes (SWAT). Predictive, not prescriptive; not in control-oriented state-space form.
Mitigation Engineering Catalog of effective techniques for source, route, remove. Siloed evaluation; no framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.
Resource Economics Methods to value water (VOLW, shadow pricing). Static, average costs; do not model non-linear scarcity or link to control.
Control Theory Tools for stochastic optimization of dynamic systems (SDP, MPC). Not applied to the state variable of reservoir storage capacity itself.

This thesis directly addresses these four gaps. It builds upon the contributions of each discipline—using RUSLE/MUSLE for sediment yield, established mitigation techniques as control actions, VOLW for penalty construction, and HJB/stochastic control for optimization—but integrates them into a novel, coherent Cyber-Physical Control Framework. The following chapters detail the synthesis of these components into a mathematically rigorous and practically validated approach to sediment management.
