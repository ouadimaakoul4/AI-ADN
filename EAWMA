Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in natural language tasks but remain fundamentally limited by their token-prediction paradigm, lacking grounded world understanding, causal reasoning, and autonomous decision-making capabilities. We propose EAWMA (Embodied Agentic World Model Architecture), a unified framework for autonomous intelligence that integrates multimodal perception, predictive world modeling, hierarchical planning, episodic memory, and neuro-symbolic reasoning. EAWMA moves beyond pattern completion to implement a complete perception-action cycle with explicit world simulation. The architecture formalizes the interaction between neural and symbolic components through a Bayesian inference framework, enabling explainable, safe, and adaptive behavior. We present the mathematical foundations, system architecture, and a research roadmap toward artificial general intelligence capable of real-world interaction and reasoning.

Keywords: Embodied AI, World Models, Neuro-Symbolic AI, Agentic Systems, Autonomous Intelligence

1. Introduction

The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a significant milestone in artificial intelligence, demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in language understanding and generation [1, 2]. However, their limitations in grounded reasoning, causal understanding, and autonomous planning constrain their applicability to real-world tasks requiring interaction with dynamic environments [3, 4].

The fundamental limitation stems from the token-prediction objective: LLMs optimize for statistical coherence rather than physical or causal fidelity. This results in several critical shortcomings:

1. Lack of Grounding: LLMs cannot model physical dynamics or sensorimotor interactions [5].
2. Brittle Reasoning: Performance degrades with complex multi-step planning and counterfactual scenarios [6].
3. Static Knowledge: Adaptation requires retraining rather than incremental learning [7].
4. Opacity: Decision processes are not easily interpretable or verifiable [8].

We hypothesize that true general intelligence requires an integrated architecture that explicitly separates and coordinates perception, simulation, planning, and action. EAWMA embodies this principle through five core components:

1. Multimodal Perception that encodes sensory data into structured representations
2. World Simulation Engine that predicts environment dynamics
3. Hierarchical Planning that generates goal-directed action sequences
4. Episodic Memory that enables experience-based adaptation
5. Neuro-Symbolic Reasoner that enforces logical and safety constraints

This paper makes three primary contributions:

1. A formal architecture specification for embodied agentic intelligence
2. A mathematical framework unifying perception, prediction, and planning
3. A research roadmap with concrete benchmarks and evaluation metrics

3. Mathematical Foundations

3.1 Notation and Problem Formulation

Let the agent interact with an environment over discrete time steps  t = 1, 2, \ldots . At each step:

· Observation:  o_t \in \mathcal{O}  (multimodal sensory input)
· Action:  a_t \in \mathcal{A}  (motor commands or symbolic actions)
· State:  s_t \in \mathcal{S}  (latent world state, partially observable)
· Reward:  r_t \in \mathbb{R}  (scalar feedback)

The agent maintains a belief state  b_t = P(s_t \mid o_{1:t}, a_{1:t-1})  representing its uncertainty about the true world state.

3.2 Perception as Variational Inference

The perception module learns an encoder  q_\phi(z_t \mid o_t)  that maps raw observations to a structured latent representation  z_t , where  z_t  decomposes into:

· Object-centric representations:  z_t = \{z_t^i\}_{i=1}^K  for K entities
· Relational embeddings:  R(z_t^i, z_t^j)  capturing spatial/temporal relations

We optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

\mathcal{L}_{\text{perc}} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi}[\log p_\theta(o_t \mid z_t)] - \beta \cdot D_{KL}(q_\phi(z_t \mid o_t) \parallel p(z_t))

where  p(z_t)  is a prior encouraging factorized, interpretable representations.

3.3 World Model as Latent Dynamics

The world simulation engine learns transition dynamics in latent space:

z_{t+1} \sim p_\psi(z_{t+1} \mid z_t, a_t)

We model this as a structured state-space model:

\begin{aligned}
h_{t+1} &= f_\psi(h_t, z_t, a_t) \quad \text{(deterministic transition)} \\
z_{t+1} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\psi(h_{t+1}), \Sigma_\psi(h_{t+1})) \quad \text{(stochastic emission)}
\end{aligned}

The model is trained to maximize predictive accuracy:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}} = \mathbb{E}[\log p_\psi(z_{t+1} \mid z_t, a_t)] + \lambda \cdot \mathbb{E}[\log p_\psi(o_{t+1} \mid z_{t+1})]

3.4 Planning as Bayesian Inference

Given a goal  g  (which may be specified as a target state, reward function, or natural language instruction), planning becomes inference over action sequences:

P(a_{t:t+H} \mid z_t, g) \propto P(g \mid z_{t:t+H}) \cdot P(z_{t:t+H} \mid z_t, a_{t:t+H}) \cdot P(a_{t:t+H})

We approximate this using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in latent space:

1. Selection: Traverse tree using UCB:  \text{UCB}(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c \sqrt{\frac{\log N(s)}{N(s,a)}} 
2. Expansion: Add new node for state  s' \sim p_\psi(s' \mid s, a) 
3. Simulation: Roll out using default policy to estimate  V(s') 
4. Backpropagation: Update  Q(s,a)  and  N(s,a) 

3.5 Memory as Compressed Experience

The episodic memory stores trajectories  \tau = (z_t, a_t, r_t, z_{t+1})  in a differentiable key-value store:

\text{Memory } M = \{(k_i, v_i)\}_{i=1}^N

where  k_i = \text{enc}_k(z_t)  and  v_i = (z_t, a_t, r_t, z_{t+1}) . Retrieval uses attention:

w_i = \frac{\exp(\text{sim}(q, k_i)/\tau)}{\sum_j \exp(\text{sim}(q, k_j)/\tau)}, \quad \text{retrieved} = \sum_i w_i v_i

with  q = \text{enc}_q(z_{\text{current}}) .

3.6 Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning as Constrained Optimization

The neuro-symbolic reasoner integrates logical constraints into the planning process. Let  \mathcal{C} = \{C_1, \ldots, C_m\}  be a set of constraints (e.g., safety rules, physical laws). We modify the planning objective:

a^*_{t:t+H} = \arg\max_{a_{t:t+H}} \mathbb{E}[\sum_{k=0}^{H} \gamma^k r_{t+k}] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall i, k: C_i(z_{t+k}) = \text{True}

We implement this via differentiable logic [18], where constraints are expressed as fuzzy logic formulas with differentiable satisfaction degrees.

Appendices

A. Mathematical Derivations

A.1 Variational Bound Derivation

The evidence lower bound for the perception module:

\begin{aligned}
\log p(o) &\geq \mathbb{E}_{q(z|o)}[\log p(o|z)] - D_{KL}(q(z|o) \parallel p(z)) \\
&= \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(o|z)] - \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log q(z|o) - \log p(z)]
\end{aligned}

A.2 Planning as Inference

The optimal action sequence maximizes:

P(a_{1:T} \mid o_{1:T}) \propto \exp\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}[r_t]\right) \cdot P(a_{1:T})

Under constraints  C , this becomes:

P(a_{1:T} \mid o_{1:T}, C) \propto \exp\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}[r_t]\right) \cdot P(a_{1:T}) \cdot \mathbb{I}[C(a_{1:T})]
