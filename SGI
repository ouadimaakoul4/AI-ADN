The Cyber-Physical Foundations of Post-SGI Growth: A Thesis on Modeling Intelligence-Constrained Civilizational Trajectories

Abstract
The prospective development of Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)—defined as an autonomous system capable of validated, cross-domain scientific discovery—is treated not as a singular technological event but as the introduction of a new, governable factor of production. This thesis presents a formal cyber-physical systems model of civilizational-scale growth, in which the cognitive potential of SGI is dynamically bounded by and coupled with the material realities of energy, mineral, and thermodynamic constraints. We move beyond speculative AI economics to establish a quantitative, simulation-ready framework. The model reveals that the critical determinant of long-term trajectory is not algorithmic progress alone, but the governance of SGI's cognitive output toward optimizing its own physical substrate. We identify compute energy density as the paramount stress parameter and formalize the decisive policy lever: the allocation of SGI's effort between pure knowledge expansion and the recursive improvement of its enabling infrastructure. The result is a "Green Discontinuity" pathway of sustainable acceleration versus a "Constrained Discontinuity" of stalled growth, providing a rigorous foundation for policy, investment, and strategic planning in the era of transformative AI.

Chapter 1: Introduction – From Speculation to Systems Modeling

The discourse surrounding advanced artificial intelligence has long been bifurcated between visions of utopian acceleration and dystopian collapse, often lacking a formal bridge to classical economic and systems theory. This thesis argues that the emergence of a capability like Scientific General Intelligence (SGI) necessitates a new modeling paradigm: cyber-physical growth theory.

We posit that intelligence, divorced from the physical systems that instantiate and sustain it, is an economic abstraction with limited predictive power. Therefore, the core research question is: How do the bidirectional feedback loops between a cognitively accelerating force (SGI) and the hard constraints of the physical world (energy, materials, thermodynamics) shape plausible civilizational growth trajectories?

This work synthesizes concepts from endogenous growth theory, resource economics, and complex systems engineering to build the first integrated model of SGI-driven development that is mathematically formalized, computationally simulatable, and grounded in measurable physical parameters.

Chapter 2: Foundational Definitions & The SGI Threshold

2.1 The Intelligence Hierarchy: AGI, SGI, ASI

· Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): A system exhibiting robust, human-level cognitive proficiency across domains, capable of learning and reasoning on novel tasks. It is the necessary cognitive precursor.
· Scientific General Intelligence (SGI): An AI system that autonomously performs the complete loop of scientific inquiry—hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, and validation—producing frontier knowledge across multiple domains with minimal human intervention. Its output directly enters the economy's technological production function.
· Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): A hypothetical system far surpassing human intellect in all domains, characterized by recursive self-improvement. Its timeline remains highly uncertain, but the emergence of dangerous capability clusters (e.g., autonomous replication) presents a nearer-term risk horizon.

2.2 The Critical Bottleneck: From AGI to SGI
The transition from AGI to SGI is non-automatic. We define the key constraint as the Experimental Grounding Coefficient (κ), representing the degree to which general cognition can be effectively coupled with physical validation platforms (labs, robotics, high-fidelity simulators). Formally:
SGI Emerges When: AGI Capability × κ ≥ Scientific Autonomy Threshold
This bottleneck clarifies why software prowess alone is insufficient and highlights infrastructure (e.g., automated labs, sensor networks) as a critical investment and policy target.

Chapter 3: The Core Economic Model – SGI as an Idea Production Shock

3.1 The Augmented Idea Production Function
We base our growth engine on a modified endogenous growth (Romer-style) model. The baseline production of ideas (Ā) is:
Ā̇ = η · R^λ · A^φ
where R is human R&D labor, η is research productivity, and φ represents knowledge spillovers.

SGI acts as a direct augmenter of research capital:
Ā̇ = η · (R + σ_effective · SGI)^λ · A^φ
Here, σ_effective is the effective scientific efficiency of SGI, which becomes the central variable of our coupled system.

3.2 Transmission to Economic Output
Economic output (Y) follows a standard Cobb-Douglas function:
Y = A · K^α · L^(1−α)
SGI affects the economy solely through A, the total factor productivity (TFP) derived from the idea stock. This creates a clean, defensible causal chain: SGI → faster idea growth → higher TFP → increased GDP.

3.3 Labor Market Dynamics
Employment evolves based on the competition between automation and new task creation:
L̇ = −β · L_exposed + γ · A

· β: Labor substitution rate from automation.
· γ: New task creation rate, which we model as endogenous to SGI's output and its governance. This formalizes the insight that the direction of innovation (e.g., toward human-augmenting tools vs. human-replacing systems) is a policy-sensitive variable.

Chapter 4: The Physical Layer – The Constraints That Bind Intelligence

This chapter introduces the thesis's core contribution: formally coupling cognitive growth to physical limits.

4.1 The Physical Cost Function (C_phys)
The effective capability of SGI is suppressed by aggregate physical constraints:
C_phys(t) = w_E · C_E(t) + w_M · C_M(t) + w_T · C_T(t)
where w are weights summing to 1, and:

· C_E (Energy Constraint): Compute Energy Demand / Clean Energy Supply. Captures the grid's ability to power growth.
· C_M (Mineral Constraint): Σ (Demand for Critical Mineral_i / Accessible Supply_i). Captures geopolitical and supply-chain fragility.
· C_T (Thermodynamic Constraint): Heat Generated by Compute / Cooling Capacity. Captures the often-overlooked bottleneck of waste heat dissipation.

4.2 The Constraint Coupling
The raw scientific efficiency (σ_raw) of SGI is thus throttled by physical reality:
σ_effective(t) = σ_raw(t) / (1 + C_phys(t))
This is the fundamental equation of cyber-physical growth. Exponential growth in σ_raw yields only logarithmic growth in σ_effective if C_phys escalates in tandem.

4.3 The Optimization Multiplier (ξ_opt) – The Hope of Recursive Improvement
SGI can be directed to improve the very systems that constrain it. For each sector i (Energy, Minerals, Cooling):
ξ_opt,i(t+1) = ξ_opt,i(t) + η_i · σ_effective(t) · f_alloc,i

· η_i: Sectoral convertibility coefficient (how good SGI is at R&D in this domain).
· f_alloc,i: The critical governance variable: the fraction of SGI's cognitive output allocated to optimizing sector i.

Successful optimization relaxes constraints:
C_i(t+1) = C_i(t) / (1 + ξ_opt,i(t))

Chapter 5: Integrated System Architecture & Simulation

5.1 The Cyber-Physical Feedback Loop
The model forms a closed loop:

1. SGI capability (σ_effective) drives idea production (Ā̇).
2. Ideas (A) boost economic output (Y) and labor evolution (L̇).
3. Economic activity increases demand for compute and infrastructure, raising physical constraints (C_phys).
4. Constraints throttle effective SGI capability (σ_effective).
5. Governance allocates a portion of SGI's output (f_alloc) to optimize physical systems, reducing constraints (C_phys) and closing the loop.

5.2 Simulation Pseudocode & Implementation
(The precise, simulation-ready pseudocode you provided is integrated here as the formal specification of the model dynamics, forming the basis for a digital twin implementation in Python/Julia.)

Chapter 6: Analysis – Stress Testing and The Two Discontinuities

6.1 The Most Sensitive Parameter: Compute Energy Density (ρ_power)
Thesis analysis identifies compute power density (W/m²) as the paramount stress-test variable. It is the silent governor of C_T and C_E. Stagnation in ρ_power leads to an inevitable "physical singularity wall" where data center sprawl and energy demand outpace infrastructure, causing σ_effective to collapse irrespective of algorithmic gains.

6.2 Defining the Archetypal Trajectories

· The Green Discontinuity: High f_alloc to Energy & Cooling sectors, coupled with strong convertibility (η). SGI rapidly solves fusion, advanced cooling, and material efficiency. C_phys falls, σ_effective rises, enabling a sustainable, accelerating TFP boom.
· The Constrained Discontinuity: Low f_alloc to physical optimization. SGI's raw capability grows but is increasingly throttled by escalating C_phys. Growth stalls, inflationary pressures rise, and the system becomes vulnerable to the financial shock module (modeled as a stochastic Bernoulli shock triggered by infrastructure crises).

Chapter 7: Discussion – Implications for Governance and Strategy

This model reframes governance from a passive regulatory function to an active control systems problem. The state's role is to dynamically adjust the allocation lever f_alloc and invest in sectors that improve the convertibility coefficients η_i. Key implications:

· Industrial Policy: Prioritizing investments in automated labs, advanced cooling R&D, and resilient mineral recycling is not industrial policy but civilizational substrate policy.
· Risk Management: The financial "AI bubble" is modeled as a derivative risk of the physical constraints; a "progress stall" triggered by a C_phys wall would lead to a severe market correction (Y_t = Y*_t · (1 − θ · S_t)).
· Global Coordination: The model illustrates why fragmented, competitive development likely leads to a "Constrained Discontinuity" outcome, as competitors optimize for short-term cognitive gains (σ_raw) over long-term systemic health.

Chapter 8: Conclusion – Intelligence is Not the Engine

This thesis concludes with a foundational insight: Intelligence is not the ultimate engine of growth; energy throughput is. Intelligence is its reorganizer. SGI represents the potential for a super-efficient reorganizer. Our cyber-physical model demonstrates that realizing this potential is not guaranteed. It depends on a conscious, pre-emptive effort to couple cognitive advancement with physical optimization—to build the metabolic system that can sustain the mind we are creating.

The presented framework provides the missing link between AI speculation and actionable, quantitative planning. It offers not a prediction, but a bound on the future—a tool for navigating the transition toward and beyond the scientific intelligence frontier.


Appendices

Appendix A: Complete Mathematical Formalization

This appendix provides the full mathematical specification of the Cyber-Physical Growth Model.

A.1 Core Economic Growth Module

A.1.1 Idea Production Function
The model is based on an augmented endogenous growth framework. The stock of ideas  A(t)  evolves as:

\dot{A}(t) = \eta \cdot \left( R(t) + \sigma_{\text{effective}}(t) \cdot \text{SGI}(t) \right)^{\lambda} \cdot A(t)^{\phi}

Where:

·  \dot{A}(t) : Time derivative of the idea stock (new ideas per unit time).
·  \eta : Research productivity parameter, calibrating the efficiency of the R&D process.
·  R(t) : Effective human research labor, adjusted for skill and capital augmentation.
·  \sigma_{\text{effective}}(t) : Effective scientific efficiency of the SGI system (see A.2.2).
·  \text{SGI}(t) : A measure of deployed SGI capital (e.g., petaflops-seconds dedicated to scientific reasoning).
·  \lambda : Returns to scale on research inputs (human + SGI), typically  \lambda \leq 1 .
·  \phi : Intertemporal knowledge spillover parameter.  \phi > 0  indicates that a larger existing idea stock makes future research more productive (standing on shoulders effect).  \phi < 1  ensures the growth rate can be bounded.

A.1.2 Final Goods Production
The aggregate production function for final output  Y(t)  is:

Y(t) = A(t) \cdot K(t)^{\alpha} \cdot L(t)^{1-\alpha}

Where:

·  K(t) : Physical capital stock.
·  L(t) : Total labor input, adjusted by human capital.
·  \alpha : Output elasticity of capital.

A.1.3 Labor Dynamics
The evolution of labor in tasks susceptible to automation is governed by:

\dot{L}(t) = -\beta(t) \cdot L_{\text{exposed}}(t) + \gamma(t) \cdot A(t)

Where:

·  \beta(t) : Time-varying labor displacement rate from automation.
·  L_{\text{exposed}}(t) : Portion of labor force in roles technically automatable by SGI/AI.
·  \gamma(t) : Endogenous new task creation rate, modeled as  \gamma(t) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \cdot f_{\text{alloc, labor}}(t) \cdot \sigma_{\text{effective}}(t) . This formalizes the policy lever ( f_{\text{alloc, labor}} ) of directing SGI to create new human roles.

A.2 Physical Constraint Module

A.2.1 Component Constraints
The aggregate physical constraint index  C_{\text{phys}}(t)  is a weighted sum:

C_{\text{phys}}(t) = w_E \cdot C_E(t) + w_M \cdot C_M(t) + w_T \cdot C_T(t), \quad \sum w = 1

1. Energy Constraint:

C_E(t) = \frac{D_{\text{compute}}(A(t), \text{SGI}(t))}{S_{\text{clean}}(t)}

·  D_{\text{compute}} : Energy demand of the computational substrate. Scales with  A(t)  and  \text{SGI}(t) .
·  S_{\text{clean}} : Supply of dispatchable, low-carbon energy.

2. Mineral/Material Constraint:

C_M(t) = \max_i \left( \frac{D_i(t)}{S_i(t)} \right)

· Focuses on the most bottlenecked critical material  i  (e.g., Terbium, Gallium, Lithium).  D_i  and  S_i  are demand and economically viable supply, respectively.

3. Thermodynamic Cooling Constraint:

C_T(t) = \frac{Q_{\text{compute}}(t)}{C_{\text{cooling}}(t)} = \frac{ \rho_{\text{power}}(t) \cdot \text{Area}(t) }{ C_{\text{cooling}}(t) }

·  Q_{\text{compute}} : Total waste heat generated.
·  \rho_{\text{power}} : Compute energy density (W/m²), the critical stress parameter.
·  \text{Area} : Physical footprint of compute infrastructure.
·  C_{\text{cooling}} : Cooling capacity, a function of technology and water/energy availability.

A.2.2 Cyber-Physical Coupling Equation
The raw capability of SGI,  \sigma_{\text{raw}}(t) , is throttled by the physical constraint index:

\sigma_{\text{effective}}(t) = \frac{\sigma_{\text{raw}}(t)}{1 + C_{\text{phys}}(t)}

This is the key equation that binds cognitive growth to physical reality.

A.3 Optimization Feedback Module

SGI can be allocated to optimize the constraining systems. For each sector  j \in \{E, M, T\} :

A.3.1 Optimization Multiplier Dynamics:

\xi_{\text{opt}, j}(t+1) = \xi_{\text{opt}, j}(t) + \eta_j \cdot \sigma_{\text{effective}}(t) \cdot f_{\text{alloc}, j}(t)

·  \eta_j : Sector-specific convertibility coefficient (SGI's R&D efficiency in that sector).
·  f_{\text{alloc}, j} : Governance variable: fraction of SGI output directed to sector  j , with  \sum f_{\text{alloc}} \leq 1 .

A.3.2 Constraint Relaxation:
Successful optimization relaxes the base constraint:

C_j(t+1) = \frac{C_j(t)}{1 + \xi_{\text{opt}, j}(t)}

A.4 Financial Shock Module

Systemic risk from a "progress stall" or bubble burst is modeled as a stochastic event:

Y_{\text{observed}}(t) = Y_{\text{potential}}(t) \cdot \left(1 - \theta \cdot S_t \right)

·  \theta : Shock severity parameter (e.g., 0.02 for a mild 2% GDP contraction).
·  S_t : A Bernoulli random variable where  P(S_t = 1) = p_{\text{shock}} .
· Shock Probability:  p_{\text{shock}}  increases with rising  C_{\text{phys}}(t)  and with the ratio  \sigma_{\text{raw}}(t) / \sigma_{\text{effective}}(t)  (the "frustration gap").

Appendix D: Extended Scenario Analysis & Stress Test Protocol

D.1 Formal Scenario Definitions

Scenario Governing Principle Key Parameter Shifts Expected Macro Signature
Green Discontinuity Preemptive Coupling: SGI development is coupled with and prioritized for physical system optimization. - High f_alloc_E, f_alloc_T (≥0.3 each) - High η_E, η_T - Policy-driven g_{S_clean} > 7% - Rising ρ_power over time 1. Short-term (1-10 yrs): High investment, moderate growth. 2. Medium-term (10-30 yrs): C_phys peaks and declines. σ_effective uncouples from σ_raw, leading to accelerating, sustainable growth.
Constrained Discontinuity Cognitive Decoupling: SGI capability races ahead of physical infrastructure. - Low f_alloc to physical sectors (<0.1 each) - ρ_power stagnant - g_{S_clean} follows business-as-usual (~3%) 1. Short-term: Rapid initial GDP bumps from software/service automation. 2. Medium-term: C_phys rises sharply. σ_effective plateaus. 3. Long-term: Growth stalls, high inflation in hardware/energy, high probability of a major financial shock (S_t).
Managed Transition Adaptive Governance: Policy reacts to emerging bottlenecks. - f_alloc parameters adjust dynamically in response to rising C_phys. - Moderate initial investment in physical tech. An "S-curve" trajectory: initial lag, followed by accelerated growth as policies kick in, aiming to asymptotically approach the Green Discontinuity path.

D.2 Stress Test Protocol: Compute Energy Density (ρ_power)

Objective: To identify the threshold at which stagnation in compute energy density causes systemic collapse, and to quantify the intervention required to prevent it.

Procedure:

1. Baseline Run: Set g_{ρ_power} = 0% (no improvement in W/m²). Run the Constrained Discontinuity scenario.
2. Identify Collapse Metrics:
   · Record the year t_collapse when σ_effective peaks and begins a sustained decline despite rising σ_raw.
   · Record the maximum achieved C_phys and the corresponding GDP loss relative to a scenario with unconstrained σ_raw.
3. Intervention Sweep: For a range of target ρ_power growth rates (e.g., 0%, 2%, 5%, 10% p.a.):
   · Set the required f_alloc_T and η_T to achieve that growth rate.
   · Run the model and record the long-term (e.g., Year 50) GDP, σ_effective, and C_phys.
4. Analysis: Plot the results. The curve will show a sharp nonlinear transition—a "phase change"—from a collapsed to a thriving regime at a critical minimum ρ_power growth rate. This critical point defines a minimum viable investment in cooling/physical compute R&D.

Interpretation: This stress test provides a quantifiable engineering target for policymakers and industry: "To avoid a civilizational growth stall, aggregate R&D must sustain at least an X% annual improvement in computational energy density."
