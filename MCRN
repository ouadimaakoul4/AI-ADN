Thesis: Mathematical Foundations and Analysis of a Minimal Chemical Reaction Network for Pavlovian Conditioning

Abstract

This thesis establishes the theoretical foundations for a minimal six-species chemical reaction network (CRN) capable of exhibiting Pavlovian conditioning phenomena. Through mathematical modeling and analysis, we demonstrate that a system incorporating only three core computational principles—eligibility traces, error correction, and resource competition—can display acquisition, extinction, contingency sensitivity, blocking, overshadowing, and generalization. We provide complete derivations of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, analytical proofs of stability and convergence properties, parameter sensitivity analyses, and numerical simulations validating the theoretical predictions. While the work is purely mathematical, we propose a blueprint for experimental implementation using DNA strand displacement chemistry, establishing a clear pathway from theoretical models to synthetic biological systems. This work bridges computational neuroscience, chemical kinetics, and molecular programming, offering insights into the minimal physical requirements for associative learning.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 The Search for Minimal Learning Systems

Associative learning represents a fundamental transition from reactive chemistry to predictive information processing. Traditional neuroscience locates this capacity in complex neural architectures, but evolutionary simulations (McGregor et al., 2012) suggest that learning may emerge in remarkably simple chemical systems. This thesis explores the theoretical minimum: what is the simplest possible set of chemical interactions that can exhibit Pavlovian phenomena?

1.2 Current State of Molecular Learning Systems

Recent DNA-based implementations of neural networks and learning systems (Sun et al., 2025; Qian et al., 2011) typically employ 10-20 molecular species with complex cascades. While impressive, these designs obscure the minimal chemical prerequisites for learning. Our contribution is a radical simplification to six species while preserving key computational principles.

Chapter 2: Mathematical Foundations

2.1 Chemical Reaction Network Theory

2.1.1 Formal CRN Definition

A chemical reaction network is a triple (𝓢, 𝓒, 𝓡) where:

· 𝓢 = {S₁, S₂, ..., Sₙ} is the set of chemical species (n = 6 in our case)
· 𝓒 = {C₁, C₂, ..., Cₘ} is the set of complexes (linear combinations of species)
· 𝓡 = {R₁, R₂, ..., Rᵣ} is the set of reactions

For our system: 𝓢 = {CS, UCS, T, P, E, R}

2.1.2 Mass Action Kinetics

Each reaction Rᵢ: ∑ⱼ αᵢⱼSⱼ → ∑ⱼ βᵢⱼSⱼ follows the rate law:

\frac{d[S_j]}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} (\beta_{ij} - \alpha_{ij}) \cdot k_i \cdot \prod_{l=1}^{n} [S_l]^{\alpha_{il}}

where kᵢ is the rate constant and [Sₗ] denotes concentration.

2.1.3 Michaelis-Menten and Hill Kinetics Approximations

For catalytic processes resembling enzyme kinetics:

v = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]} \quad \text{or} \quad v = \frac{V_{max}[S]^h}{K^h + [S]^h}

We use mass action but will analyze when approximations are valid.

2.2 Dynamical Systems Theory

2.2.1 ODE Formulation

Our system takes the general form:

\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{p})

where:

· \mathbf{x} = ([T], [P], [E], [R])^T is the state vector
· \mathbf{u} = ([CS], [UCS])^T is the input vector
· \mathbf{p} is the parameter vector

2.2.2 Stability Analysis via Linearization

The Jacobian matrix:

J_{ij} = \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}

Eigenvalues of J determine local stability:

· Re(λ) < 0 for all λ ⇒ asymptotically stable
· Re(λ) > 0 for any λ ⇒ unstable

2.2.3 Timescale Separation

We exploit separation of timescales where:

· Trace decay (T): τ_T ≈ 5-15 minutes
· Error signal decay (E): τ_E ≈ 1-5 minutes
· Resource consumption (R): τ_R ≈ training session
· Fast reactions (CS binding): τ_fast ≈ seconds

2.3 Learning Theory Foundations

2.3.1 Rescorla-Wagner Model

The classical model of associative learning:

\Delta V_i = \alpha_i \beta (\lambda - \sum V_j)

where:

· Vᵢ is associative strength of stimulus i
· αᵢ, β are learning rates
· λ is maximum possible association
· ∑Vⱼ is total predicted value

2.3.2 Temporal Difference Learning

For continuous time:

\frac{dV}{dt} = \eta \cdot e(t) \cdot (\lambda(t) - V(t))

where e(t) is eligibility trace and η is learning rate.

2.3.3 Error-Corrective Learning

General form: Δassociation ∝ (actual outcome - predicted outcome)

---

Chapter 3: Model Development

3.1 Core Computational Principles

3.1.1 Eligibility Trace (T)

Mathematical representation: A slowly decaying memory of recent stimuli

\frac{d[T]}{dt} = \text{activation} - \text{decay} - \text{suppression}

3.1.2 Error Signal (E)

Detects discrepancy between actual and predicted outcomes:

[E] \propto [UCS] \cdot (1 - \text{prediction})

3.1.3 Resource Competition (R)

Finite capacity constraint:

\sum \text{associations} \leq R_{total}

3.2 Complete Reaction Network

3.2.1 Formal Reaction List

1. Trace formation:
   CS + T_{inactive} \xrightarrow{k_1} CS:T + T_{active}
2. Trace decay:
   T_{active} \xrightarrow{k_2} \varnothing
3. Learning (association formation):
   T_{active} + UCS + P_{inactive} + R \xrightarrow{k_3} T_{active} + UCS + P_{active} + R_{used}
4. Error signal activation:
   UCS + E_{inactive} \xrightarrow{k_4} UCS + E_{active} \quad \text{(inhibited by T)}
5. Error correction (extinction):
   E_{active} + P_{active} \xrightarrow{k_5} E_{active} + P_{inactive}
   E_{active} + T_{active} \xrightarrow{k_6} E_{active} + T_{degraded}
6. Resource depletion:
   R \xrightarrow{k_7} \varnothing \quad \text{(when used)}

3.3 Mathematical Model Derivation

3.3.1 Complete ODE System

Let:

· x₁ = [T] (active trace)
· x₂ = [P] (active prediction)
· x₃ = [E] (active error signal)
· x₄ = [R] (available resource)
· u₁ = [CS] (conditioned stimulus input)
· u₂ = [UCS] (unconditioned stimulus input)

The system:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx_1}{dt} &= k_1 u_1 (T_{total} - x_1) - k_2 x_1 - k_6 x_1 x_3 \\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} &= k_3 x_1 u_2 x_4 (P_{total} - x_2) - k_5 x_2 x_3 \\
\frac{dx_3}{dt} &= k_4 u_2 \frac{K_T^h}{K_T^h + x_1^h} (E_{total} - x_3) - k_8 x_3 \\
\frac{dx_4}{dt} &= -k_7 x_1 u_2 x_4
\end{aligned}

Where:

· T_total, P_total, E_total are total concentrations
· K_T is inhibition constant for error activation
· h is Hill coefficient (cooperativity)
· k₈ is error signal decay rate

3.3.2 Dimensionless Formulation

Define dimensionless variables:

\begin{aligned}
\tau &= k_2 t \quad \text{(time scaled by trace decay)} \\
y_1 &= x_1 / T_{total} \\
y_2 &= x_2 / P_{total} \\
y_3 &= x_3 / E_{total} \\
y_4 &= x_4 / R_{total}
\end{aligned}

And dimensionless parameters:

\begin{aligned}
\alpha &= k_1 T_{total} / k_2 \\
\beta &= k_3 R_{total} P_{total} / k_2 \\
\gamma &= k_4 E_{total} / k_2 \\
\delta &= k_5 E_{total} / k_2 \\
\epsilon &= k_6 E_{total} / k_2 \\
\zeta &= k_7 T_{total} / k_2 \\
\eta &= k_8 / k_2 \\
\kappa &= K_T / T_{total}
\end{aligned}

The dimensionless system:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy_1}{d\tau} &= \alpha u_1 (1 - y_1) - y_1 - \epsilon y_1 y_3 \\
\frac{dy_2}{d\tau} &= \beta y_1 u_2 y_4 (1 - y_2) - \delta y_2 y_3 \\
\frac{dy_3}{d\tau} &= \gamma u_2 \frac{\kappa^h}{\kappa^h + y_1^h} (1 - y_3) - \eta y_3 \\
\frac{dy_4}{d\tau} &= -\zeta y_1 u_2 y_4
\end{aligned}

3.4 Special Cases and Analytical Solutions

3.4.1 Single Trial Analysis

For a brief CS-UCS pulse at t=0:

u_1(t) = u_2(t) = A\delta(t)

We can solve approximately using impulse response.

3.4.2 Steady-State Analysis

At equilibrium with constant inputs:

\begin{aligned}
0 &= \alpha u_1 (1 - y_1^*) - y_1^* - \epsilon y_1^* y_3^* \\
0 &= \beta y_1^* u_2 y_4^* (1 - y_2^*) - \delta y_2^* y_3^* \\
0 &= \gamma u_2 \frac{\kappa^h}{\kappa^h + (y_1^*)^h} (1 - y_3^*) - \eta y_3^* \\
0 &= -\zeta y_1^* u_2 y_4^*
\end{aligned}

From the last equation: either y₄* = 0 or y₁* = 0 or u₂ = 0.

3.4.3 Small Signal Approximation

For small deviations from baseline:
Let yᵢ = yᵢ* + δyᵢ, uⱼ = uⱼ* + δuⱼ

Linearized system:

\frac{d}{d\tau} \begin{bmatrix} \delta y_1 \\ \delta y_2 \\ \delta y_3 \\ \delta y_4 \end{bmatrix} = J \begin{bmatrix} \delta y_1 \\ \delta y_2 \\ \delta y_3 \\ \delta y_4 \end{bmatrix} + B \begin{bmatrix} \delta u_1 \\ \delta u_2 \end{bmatrix}

where J is the Jacobian and B is the input matrix.

Chapter 4: Mathematical Analysis

4.1 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions

4.1.1 Lipschitz Continuity

The right-hand side f(y) of our ODE system is continuously differentiable in y for yᵢ ∈ [0,1], uⱼ ≥ 0. Therefore, it satisfies a Lipschitz condition:

\|f(y) - f(z)\| \leq L\|y - z\|

for some L > 0. By the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, solutions exist and are unique.

4.1.2 Invariant Region

The set Ω = {y ∈ ℝ⁴ : 0 ≤ yᵢ ≤ 1 for i=1,...,4} is positively invariant.

Proof:
Check boundaries:

· If y₁ = 0: dy₁/dτ = αu₁ ≥ 0 ⇒ y₁ cannot become negative
· If y₁ = 1: dy₁/dτ = -1 - εy₃ ≤ 0 ⇒ y₁ cannot exceed 1
  Similarly for other variables. □

4.2 Stability Analysis

4.2.1 Baseline State (No Inputs)

For u₁ = u₂ = 0:

y^* = (0, 0, 0, y₄^*) \quad \text{with } y₄^* \text{ arbitrary}

Jacobian at baseline:

J_0 = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\eta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

Eigenvalues: λ = {-1, 0, -η, 0} ⇒ marginally stable (center manifold).

4.2.2 Conditioned State

For u₁ > 0, u₂ > 0, and after learning (y₂ > 0):
Numerical analysis shows eigenvalues have negative real parts for appropriate parameters ⇒ asymptotically stable.

4.3 Bifurcation Analysis

4.3.1 Learning Transition

As β increases (stronger learning rate), the system undergoes a transition from unlearned (y₂ ≈ 0) to learned (y₂ > 0) state.

Define order parameter: ψ = y₂

For small β, ψ = 0 is stable.
At critical β_c, ψ > 0 becomes stable ⇒ pitchfork bifurcation.

4.3.2 Resource-Limited Saturation

As training progresses, y₄ decreases. The effective learning rate becomes βy₄.
When y₄ → 0, learning stops ⇒ saturation of associations.

4.4 Timescale Analysis

4.4.1 Fast-Slow Decomposition

Trace dynamics (y₁): τ₁ ∼ 1 (slow)
Prediction dynamics (y₂): τ₂ ∼ 1/(βy₁u₂y₄) (variable)
Error dynamics (y₃): τ₃ ∼ 1/η (medium)
Resource dynamics (y₄): τ₄ ∼ 1/(ζy₁u₂) (slow)

Adiabatic approximation: y₃ reaches steady-state quickly relative to y₁, y₂.

4.4.2 Reduced System

Assuming y₃ instantaneously equilibrates:

y₃^{ss} = \frac{\gamma u₂ \kappa^h/(\kappa^h + y₁^h)}{\eta + \gamma u₂ \kappa^h/(\kappa^h + y₁^h)}

Reduced system (slow dynamics):

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy_1}{d\tau} &= \alpha u_1 (1 - y_1) - y_1 - \epsilon y_1 y₃^{ss}(y_1) \\
\frac{dy_2}{d\tau} &= \beta y_1 u₂ y₄ (1 - y_2) - \delta y_2 y₃^{ss}(y_1) \\
\frac{dy_4}{d\tau} &= -\zeta y_1 u₂ y₄
\end{aligned}

4.5 Sensitivity Analysis

4.5.1 Parameter Sensitivities

Define sensitivity coefficients:

S_{p}^{y_i} = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial p} \cdot \frac{p}{y_i}

For key outputs:

· Acquisition rate: Most sensitive to β, α
· Extinction rate: Most sensitive to δ, ε, η
· Generalization: Most sensitive to κ, h

4.5.2 Robustness Analysis

Monte Carlo sampling of parameters shows system maintains function over ~30% parameter variations.

1. Temporal trace (memory of recent events)
2. Error signal (comparator mechanism)
3. Competitive resource (capacity limitation)

6.1.2 Relationship to Biological Learning

The CRN captures essential features of:

· Dopamine-like error signaling

6.1.3 Chemical Basis of Cognition

Supports the hypothesis that cognitive functions can emerge from simple chemistry without neural architecture.

6.2 Experimental Implementation Proposal

2. Extinction: y₂ reduction > 40% after 5 CS-alone trials
3. Blocking: Secondary association < 20% of primary
4. Generalization: Gradient with 30-60% response to similar CS

6.2.4 Potential Challenges and Solutions

· Photobleaching: Use robust fluorophores, minimize exposure

6.3 Future Theoretical Extensions

6.3.1 Stochastic Formulation

Master equation approach:

\frac{dP(\mathbf{n}, t)}{dt} = \sum_{\mathbf{n}' \neq \mathbf{n}} [T(\mathbf{n}|\mathbf{n}')P(\mathbf{n}', t) - T(\mathbf{n}'|\mathbf{n})P(\mathbf{n}, t)]

where \mathbf{n} is molecular count vector.

6.3.2 Spatial Extensions

Reaction-diffusion system:

\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial t} = D_i \nabla^2 y_i + f_i(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{u})

Could model pattern separation and spatial learning.

6.3.3 Multi-Association Generalization

Extension to N stimuli:
