AQUILA-L: WHITE PAPER - PART 1/3

From Mars Dreams to Lunar Realities: The Evolution of Acoustic ISRU

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This white paper documents the four-year evolution of the AQUILA project from an ambitious concept for Martian atmospheric water harvesting to a focused, scientifically-grounded prototype for lunar ice extraction. Through iterative refinement grounded in physics, mission data, and critical peer review, we have transformed an initially flawed but innovative idea into a viable technology development path.

Key Evolution:

· Initial Concept (2024): Acoustic levitation water harvester for Mars atmosphere
· Final Design (2025): Hybrid acoustic-electrostatic system for lunar permanently shadowed regions
· Pivot Rationale: Fundamental physics limitations in Martian atmosphere vs. vacuum advantages on Moon
· Current Status: Ready for 9-month, $135,000 prototype development with clear success criteria

1.0 ORIGINAL CONCEPT: AQUILA-M FOR MARS

1.1 The Ambitious Vision

In late 2024, we proposed a novel approach to Martian water extraction: using acoustic standing waves to trap and grow ice crystals from the thin Martian atmosphere. The concept was elegant in principle:

```
1. Create supersaturation zones in a chamber
2. Use ultrasonic waves to trap water ice particles
3. Grow particles via vapor deposition
4. Collect grown ice for water production
```

Theoretical Advantages:

· No moving parts in contact with ice
· Continuous operation day and night
· Potential for ultra-pure water collection
· Scalable via modular arrays

1.2 Initial Technical Specifications

Target Performance:

· Single unit: 1 liter/day water production
· Power consumption: 35W average
· Unit size: 50cm cube, 8.5kg (Earth mass)
· Operating frequency: 160 kHz

Proposed Mechanism:

```
Acoustic radiation force: F_rad ∝ V_p × ∇(p²)/(ρ_f × c²)
Where V_p = particle volume, p = acoustic pressure
Assumed trapping of 10μm particles in Martian CO₂ at 6 hPa
```

1.3 First Critical Review - Fundamental Flaws Identified

The initial concept received rigorous scrutiny, revealing three fatal flaws:

Flaw 1: Atmospheric Attenuation

```
Acoustic attenuation in CO₂ at 6 hPa, 160 kHz:
α ≈ 200 dB/m (vs. ~1-2 dB/m on Earth)
Result: Standing waves impossible over meter scales
```

Flaw 2: Water Vapor Concentration

```
Mars reality: 0.0001-0.001 g/m³ (not 0.1 g/m³ assumed)
Yield calculation: 0.00056 L/day (not 1 L/day)
Energy cost: 75,500 kWh/L (not 7.37 kWh/L)
```

Flaw 3: Particle Growth Timescale

```
Deposition growth at -80°C: dr/dt ≈ 0.001 μm/s
Time to grow 2μm→50μm: ~13 hours (not minutes)
Throughput: milligrams/day (not grams/day)
```

1.4 Iteration 1: Reality Check

Changes Made:

· Reduced frequency to 2 kHz (attenuation: 1 dB/m)
· Batch processing instead of continuous flow
· Added dust management system
· Revised yield: 0.114 L/day (still optimistic)

Remaining Issues:

· Attenuation still problematic at 1 dB/m (30% loss over 1m)
· Power requirements underestimated (100W+ needed)
· Dust fouling unaddressed in Martian conditions

1.5 Iteration 2: Data-Driven Pivot

Analysis of NASA mission data forced a fundamental reconsideration:

Mars Data (Curiosity, Phoenix, MAVEN):

· Water vapor: 10-100 ppmv (0.0001-0.001 g/m³)
· Atmospheric pressure: 6 hPa average
· Temperature: -60°C average, -125°C to 20°C range

Yield Reality Check:

```
At 0.001 g/m³, 48 m³/day processing:
Water available: 0.048 g/day
With 19% efficiency: 0.0091 g/day
= 9.1 mg/day per 1m³ unit
```

Conclusion: Mars atmospheric water harvesting via acoustics is energetically impossible for bulk water production.

2.0 THE PIVOT: LUNAR OPPORTUNITY

2.1 Why the Moon Solves Our Problems

Parameter Mars (Problem) Moon (Solution)
Atmosphere 6 hPa CO₂ (high attenuation) 10⁻¹⁰ Pa vacuum (no attenuation)
Water Form Sparse vapor (0.001 g/m³) Solid ice (3-10% wt) in regolith
Medium Low-density gas (ρ=0.02 kg/m³) Granular solid (ρ=1.6 g/cm³)
Propagation Waves attenuate rapidly Surface waves propagate kilometers
Energy Cost 75,500 kWh/L (impossible) 0.05-0.2 kWh/kg (competitive)

2.2 New Concept: LUNA-AQUILA

Core Principle: Use surface acoustic waves to fluidize and separate ice from regolith in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).

Three-Phase Separation:

1. Low-frequency vibration (100-500 Hz): Fluidize regolith layer
2. Ultrasonic waves (40 kHz): Separate ice by density contrast
3. Electrostatic field (5 kV): Collect ice particles

Science Basis:

· Ice density: 0.92 g/cm³ vs. regolith: 1.6 g/cm³ (74% contrast)
· Acoustic impedance difference enables separation
· Triboelectric charging provides additional separation mechanism

2.3 Validation from Lunar Missions

LCROSS Impact (2009):

· Confirmed 5.6±2.9% water ice in Cabeus crater
· Ice forms: frost, pore-filling, ice-bound grains

LRO Diviner:

· PSR temperatures: 25-70K (-248°C to -203°C)
· Ice stable for billions of years

Chandrayaan-1 M³:

· Hydroxyl/water signature in sunlit regions (0.5-1% wt)
· Diurnal migration suggests surface processes

3.0 CRITICAL PHYSICS VALIDATION

3.1 Two Key Unknowns

Before committing to development, we identified two critical physics questions requiring experimental validation:

Unknown 1: Acoustic Attenuation in Fluidized Regolith

```
Hypothesis: High-frequency waves rapidly attenuate in granular media
Measurement: Signal loss per mm in fluidized NU-LHT-3M at 100K
Threshold: <60 dB/mm for viability
```

Unknown 2: Cryogenic Triboelectric Charging

```
Hypothesis: Ice and regolith develop sufficient charge difference
Measurement: ΔV between separated materials at 100K
Threshold: >1 kV for effective electrostatic collection
```

3.2 Experimental Design for Validation

Phase 1 (3 months, $40,000):

1. Build cryo-vacuum test chamber (10⁻⁶ Pa, 100K capability)
2. Measure acoustic attenuation at 20-60 kHz
3. Measure triboelectric potential of ice-regolith mixtures
4. Make Go/No-Go decision for hybrid system

Success Criteria:

· Both thresholds met → Proceed with hybrid system
· Either failed → Pivot to vibration-electrostatic only
· Both failed → Complete pivot to alternative application

4.0 TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS

4.1 Novel Hybrid Approach

Why Hybrid Works Where Pure Methods Fail:

```
Pure acoustic: Attenuation limits penetration depth
Pure electrostatic: Requires pre-separated particles
Pure vibration: Mixes rather than separates
Hybrid: Combines strengths, mitigates weaknesses
```

System Integration:

```
Sequential operation (60-second cycle):
1. Vibration (10s): Fluidize top 2mm layer
2. Acoustics (20s): Separate ice via density contrast
3. Electrostatic (20s): Collect ice particles
4. Reset (10s): Prepare for next batch
```

4.2 Cryogenic Vacuum Engineering

Key Challenges & Solutions:

```
Challenge 1: Piezoelectric operation at -230°C
Solution: PZT-8 material (-200°C capability) + active heating

Challenge 2: Thermal management in vacuum
Solution: Multi-layer insulation + cryocooler integration

Challenge 3: Dust adhesion in vacuum
Solution: Electrostatic repulsion + non-stick coatings
```

4.3 Adaptive Control System

Machine Learning Integration:

```
Real-time optimization based on:
1. Regolith properties (density, ice content)
2. Environmental conditions (temperature, depth)
3. Performance feedback (separation efficiency)
```

Self-Calibration:

· Automatic tuning of frequencies and amplitudes
· Fault detection and recovery
· Performance logging for continuous improvement

3.0 PHASE 1: FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS VALIDATION

3.1 Experimental Protocol: Acoustic Attenuation

Objective: Measure signal loss per millimeter in fluidized lunar regolith simulant at cryogenic temperatures.

Setup Configuration:

```
1. Chamber: 30cm spherical vacuum chamber
2. Regolith bed: 2mm layer of NU-LHT-3M (1.6 g/cm³)
3. Transmitter: Single 40 kHz PZT transducer
4. Receiver: Miniature PZT sensor embedded 2mm below surface
5. Vibration: 300 Hz shaker for fluidization control
6. Temperature: Controlled at 100K ± 0.1K
7. Pressure: <1×10⁻⁴ Pa (to eliminate gas conduction)
```

Measurement Procedure:

```
Step 1: Calibration (empty chamber)
  - Measure direct path loss at 40 kHz
  - Characterize transducer response
  - Establish baseline SPL at receiver position

Step 2: Static regolith measurement
  - Add 2mm regolith layer
  - Measure attenuation at multiple frequencies (20-60 kHz)
  - Record amplitude and phase

Step 3: Fluidized state measurements
  - Activate vibration at 300 Hz, 2mm amplitude
  - Measure attenuation during fluidization
  - Vary fluidization intensity (50%, 75%, 90% area moving)

Step 4: Temperature dependence
  - Repeat at 80K, 100K, 120K, 150K
  - Characterize any temperature-dependent effects

Step 5: Density variation
  - Test at 1.0, 1.5, 1.8 g/cm³ packing densities

```

Data Collection:

```
Parameters recorded at 1 kHz sampling:
1. Transmitter voltage (V_peak)
2. Receiver voltage (V_rms)
3. Phase difference (degrees)
4. Temperature (16 points)
5. Vibration amplitude (accelerometer)
6. Chamber pressure

Where d = distance through regolith (2mm)

Success criterion: α < 60 dB/mm
Critical threshold: 60 dB/mm = 6000 dB/m
```

3.2 Experimental Protocol: Triboelectric Charging

Objective: Measure potential difference (ΔV) between ice and regolith grains after contact charging at cryogenic temperatures.

Setup Configuration:

```
1. Ice-regolith mixture: 3% H₂O by mass in NU-LHT-3M
2. Charging surface: Rotating drum of test material (PTFE, steel, etc.)
3. Separation chamber: Gravity-fed cascade with electrostatic deflection
4. Measurement: Dual Faraday cups with electrometers
5. Temperature: 100K ± 0.1K
6. Pressure: <1×10⁻⁴ Pa
```

Mixture Preparation:

```
Ice incorporation methods (test all three):
Method A: Vapor deposition
  - Expose cold regolith to H₂O vapor at 10⁻⁴ Pa
  - Deposit 3% by mass over 24 hours
  - Forms frost coating on grains

Method B: Cemented ice
  - Add liquid water to regolith, mix, then freeze
  - Creates ice bonds between grains
  - Simulate pore-filling ice

Method C: Granular mixture
  - Pre-form ice particles (100-500μm)
  - Mechanically mix with regolith
  - Represents discrete ice grains
```

Measurement Procedure:

```
Step 1: Single particle calibration
  - Drop individual ice and regolith grains
  - Measure charge on each particle
  - Establish baseline charge/mass ratio

Step 2: Cascade charging
  - Flow mixture over charging drum (PTFE, steel, etc.)
  - Vary drum rotation speed (0.1-1.0 m/s surface velocity)
  - Collect separated materials in Faraday cups

Step 3: Charge measurement
  - Measure integrated charge in each cup
  - Weigh collected material (microbalance)
  - Calculate charge-to-mass ratio (C/kg)

Step 4: Potential calculation
  ΔV = (q/m)_ice - (q/m)_regolith × geometric factor
  Geometric factor accounts for particle size and field geometry

Step 5: Material testing
  - Test multiple charging surfaces
  - Test at different temperatures (80K, 100K, 120K)
  - Test with different ice forms (frost, cemented, granular)
```

Success Criterion: ΔV > 1 kV for at least one material combination.

Expected Range: Based on terrestrial analogs:

· Ice-PTFE: 0.5-5 kV (ice charges positive)
· Ice-steel: 0.1-1 kV
· Ice-copper: 0.2-2 kV
