# Multi-Source Bayesian Verification System: Technical Blueprint

## Status Declaration
**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK - UNTESTED THEORETICAL DESIGN**
*This document describes a proposed system based on mathematical principles. No experimental validation has been conducted. Performance claims are hypothetical and require empirical verification.*

---

## 1. Mathematical Foundations (Theoretical)

### 1.1 Bayesian Multi-Source Verification Framework

**Definition 1.1** (Theoretical Verification Model)
Let \( C \) be a binary claim with prior probability \( P(C) \). Given \( n \) independent verification sources \( V_1, V_2, \dots, V_n \) with *assumed* accuracies \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n \in [0,1] \) and binary outputs \( s_i \in \{0,1\} \):

\[
P(C \mid \mathbf{s}) = \frac{P(C) \prod_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^{s_i}(1-\alpha_i)^{1-s_i}}{P(C) \prod_{i=1}^n \alpha_i^{s_i}(1-\alpha_i)^{1-s_i} + (1-P(C)) \prod_{i=1}^n (1-\alpha_i)^{s_i}\alpha_i^{1-s_i}}
\]

**Theorem 1.2** (Theoretical Error Bound)  
*Assuming* independent sources with minimum accuracy \( \alpha_{\min} > 0.5 \):
\[
P_{\text{error}}(k) \leq (1 - \alpha_{\min})^{n \cdot k}
\]
*Note: This bound assumes ideal conditions and known source accuracies.*

## 2. System Architecture (Proposed)

### 2.1 Component Design
```
Proposed System S = (I, P, V, M, O)
where:
I: Input interface        (claims, context)           [To be implemented]
P: Processing layer       (source selection)          [To be implemented]
V: Verification engine    (Bayesian inference)        [Theoretical design]
M: Memory store           (claims, evidence)          [Schema designed]
O: Output interface       (confidence scores)         [Design proposed]
```

### 2.2 Planned Data Flow
```
Input → Parse → [Source Selection] → [Execute Sources] → 
Bayesian Update → Store → [Calibrate] → Output
    ^                         ^
    |                         |
    [Planned]                 [Theoretical]
```

## 3. Database Schema (Designed, Not Deployed)

```sql
-- PROPOSED schema for PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE claims (
    claim_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    claim_hash BYTEA UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    claim_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    domain VARCHAR(100),
    
    -- Confidence tracking (to be populated)
    prior_confidence DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.5,
    posterior_confidence DECIMAL(5,4),
    
    -- Verification metadata (placeholder)
    verification_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    
    -- Indexes (planned)
    INDEX idx_domain (domain)
);
-- Note: Full schema in Appendix A
```

---

## 4. Core Algorithms (Pseudocode Implementation)

### Algorithm 1: Bayesian Verification Proposal
```
Input: claim C, prior P(C), sources S = {(α_i, e_i)}, budget E
Output: [Theoretical] posterior, evidence set

1. Sort sources by theoretical efficiency:
   efficiency_i = InformationGain(α_i) / e_i
   
2. For each source in sorted order:
   if energy_used + e_i ≤ E:
     result = [EXECUTE_SOURCE]  # Placeholder
     evidence.append(result)
     
     # Apply Bayesian update (theoretical)
     posterior = bayesian_update(posterior, α_i, result)
     
3. Return (posterior, evidence)  # Theoretical output
```

### Algorithm 2: Confidence Calibration Design
```
Input: [To be collected] predictions
Output: [Proposed] calibration function

1. WHEN sufficient data collected:
   - Bin predictions by confidence
   - Compute empirical accuracy per bin
   - Learn calibration mapping
   
2. Return calibration function
```

## 5. Implementation Status

### 5.1 Current State
```python
# PROTOTYPE CODE - NOT PRODUCTION READY
# Mathematical models implemented, integration pending

@dataclass
class VerificationSource:
    """Theoretical model of a verification source"""
    source_id: str
    alpha: int = 2      # Assumed initial parameters
    beta: int = 2       # To be validated empirically
    
    @property
    def expected_accuracy(self) -> float:
        """Theoretical accuracy estimate"""
        return self.alpha / (self.alpha + self.beta)  # Assumes Beta distribution
```

### 5.2 Missing Components

- [ ] Energy measurement instrumentation
- [ ] Real-time verification pipelines
- [ ] Production deployment infrastructure

## 6. Proposed Validation Methodology

### 6.1 Experimental Design
```yaml
validation_plan:
  phase_1:
    name: "Synthetic Validation"
    goal: "Verify mathematical correctness"
    method: "Generate synthetic claims with known truth"
    metrics: ["Update correctness", "Convergence rate"]
    sample_size: 1000
    
  phase_2:
    name: "Benchmark Testing"
    goal: "Compare against baselines"
    datasets: ["SciBench", "TruthfulQA", "GPQA"]
    baselines: ["Single-source", "Majority-vote", "Random-forest"]
    metrics: ["Accuracy", "Precision", "Recall", "F1"]
    
  phase_3:
    name: "Efficiency Measurement"
    goal: "Measure real-world performance"
    metrics: ["Energy consumption", "Execution time", "Throughput"]
```

### 6.2 Hypotheses to Test
1. **H₁**: Bayesian multi-source verification outperforms single-best-source by >10% accuracy
2. **H₂**: Energy-aware scheduling reduces verification cost by 25-40%
3. **H₃**: System achieves Expected Calibration Error < 0.05
4. **H₄**: Convergence follows theoretical bounds within 10% margin

### 6.3 Success Criteria
- **Minimum**: 15% improvement over baseline methods
- **Target**: 25% improvement with <50% energy increase
- **Stretch**: 35% improvement with energy-neutral operation

## 7. Performance Projections (Theoretical)

### 7.1 Expected Outcomes
Based on mathematical analysis, we *anticipate*:

| Metric | Conservative Estimate | Optimistic Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Accuracy Improvement | +10-15% | +20-30% | Over single-best-source baseline |
| Energy Efficiency | 0.8-1.2 claims/Joule | 1.5-2.0 claims/Joule | Highly dependent on source costs |
| Calibration Error | 0.06-0.10 | 0.03-0.05 | ECE metric |
| Verification Time | 500-1500 ms | 200-800 ms | Per claim |

*Note: These are projections based on theoretical analysis, not measured results.*

### 7.2 Risk Factors
1. **Source Independence Assumption**: Real sources may be correlated
2. **Accuracy Estimation**: True source accuracies unknown
3. **Energy Measurement**: Practical measurement challenges
4. **Claim Complexity**: Variable difficulty not modeled
