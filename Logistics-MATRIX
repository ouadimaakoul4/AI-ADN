Abstract

Scientific reasoning in interplanetary mission design requires integrating multimodal engineering evidence—orbital trajectories, depot state diagrams, radiation maps—with underlying systems theory and stochastic logistics. Existing AI benchmarks focus on text-only scientific QA or generic vision-language tasks, making it difficult to assess whether incorporating visual mission artifacts during model post-training improves mechanism-grounded architecture reasoning. We introduce the theoretical foundations and design of Logistics-MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for reasoning in interplanetary systems engineering. We present rigorous mathematical formulations for: (1) patched-conic trajectories and Lambert solvers; (2) propellant depot logistics with boil-off dynamics; (3) radiation environment modeling and dose accumulation; (4) in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) mass balances; and (5) stochastic campaign optimization under uncertainty. Crucially, we formalize intentional operators $\Box_\phi$ that bound entropy growth in mission state space, providing a mathematical criterion for evaluating whether reasoning processes actively reduce uncertainty rather than merely describing it. The benchmark comprises four task families—foundational astrodynamics, research-level campaign reasoning, hypothesis generation under uncertainty, and simulation interpretation—with formal definitions $(T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$ and rubric-based evaluation that explicitly scores anti-entropic reasoning. Dataset curation, alignment protocols, and evaluation infrastructure are specified in full, with target human-LLM agreement (Spearman $\rho \geq 0.85$) and hybrid objective+subjective scoring. Logistics-MATRIX is released openly under CC BY 4.0 to accelerate reproducible AI research for space systems engineering.

1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multi-step reasoning and structured problem solving (Wei et al., 2022; Wang & Zhou, 2024). As foundation models are increasingly proposed for aerospace applications—mission concept generation, trade-study assistance, and technical literature synthesis (Prabhakar et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b)—it becomes crucial to establish rigorous evaluation frameworks that test mechanism-grounded reasoning rather than superficial pattern matching.

In interplanetary systems engineering, design decisions are fundamentally grounded in mathematical models and simulation outputs: patched-conic trajectory plots, propellant depot mass-flow diagrams, radiation dose maps, and ISRU process schematics (NASA DRA 5.0, 2021; Kolluru et al., 2024). Interpreting these artifacts requires mapping perceptual structure onto engineering concepts derived from first principles: $\Delta v$ budgets from the vis-viva equation, logistics readiness from boil-off differential equations, radiation risk from integral dose models, and bootstrap feasibility from mass balance constraints.

Despite this reliance on formal mathematical reasoning, existing AI benchmarks for aerospace provide limited support for evaluating such capabilities. Many focus on text-only question answering (Zhang et al., 2025) or multiple-choice formats (Alampara et al., 2024), which do not test whether models can integrate simulation evidence with systems theory. Furthermore, recent analyses show that vision–language models can exhibit systematic reasoning failures even when surface-level perception appears strong (Ma et al., 2023; Aravindan et al., 2025), raising fundamental questions about their ability to ground abstract concepts in visual evidence.

This chapter establishes the theoretical foundations and design of Logistics-MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for interplanetary systems engineering. We make no empirical claims about model performance; instead, we provide the mathematical machinery, task formalisms, and evaluation protocols necessary for subsequent empirical investigation. The contributions are:

1. Unified Mathematical Framework: Core equations governing interplanetary logistics, with stochastic extensions and a formal definition of intentional operators $\Box_\phi$ for anti-entropic reasoning.
2. Formal Task Definitions: Each task specified as $(T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$, enabling precise, reproducible evaluation of mechanism-grounded reasoning.
3. Benchmark Architecture: Dataset structure, curation pipeline, and evaluation infrastructure with hybrid objective+subjective scoring and alignment-disruption controls.
4. Open Theoretical Toolkit: Mathematical derivations, task templates, and rubric designs released under CC BY 4.0 to accelerate aerospace AI research.

2. Mathematical Foundations of Interplanetary Logistics

This section establishes the mathematical principles underlying interplanetary mission design. We present core equations with engineering interpretation, then extend to stochastic dynamics and intentional operator theory.

Key Equation Box 2.1: Orbital Mechanics Essentials

· Vis-viva: $v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right)$
· Sphere of influence: $r_{\text{SOI}} \approx a \left( \frac{m}{M} \right)^{2/5}$
· Characteristic energy: $C_3 = v_\infty^2$
  Engineering meaning: Links position/velocity to orbit type; $C_3$ quantifies launch energy cost.

2.1 Orbital Mechanics and Patched-Conic Approximation

2.1.1 Two-Body Problem Fundamentals

For a spacecraft of mass $m \ll M$ orbiting a central body, the equation of motion is $\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\mu \mathbf{r} / r^3$ with $\mu = GM$. Conservation of specific angular momentum $\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}$ and specific mechanical energy $\mathcal{E} = v^2/2 - \mu/r$ yields the vis-viva equation above.

2.1.2 Patched-Conic Approximation

Interplanetary trajectories patch conic sections across spheres of influence. For Earth–Mars transfer: Earth departure (hyperbolic escape), heliocentric transfer (elliptical), Mars arrival (hyperbolic capture). The hyperbolic excess velocity $v_\infty$ satisfies $v_\infty^2 = v^2 - 2\mu/r$ at the SOI boundary; $C_3 = v_\infty^2$ is the key mission design parameter.

2.1.3 Gravity Assists

A gravity assist rotates the velocity vector by angle $\delta$ while preserving $v_\infty$:
\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{r_p v_\infty^2}{\mu}}


The heliocentric $\Delta \mathbf{v} = 2 v_\infty \sin(\delta/2) \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ enables trajectory shaping without propellant expenditure.

2.2 Lambert's Problem and Porkchop Plots

2.2.1 Universal Variables Formulation

Given positions $\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2$ and time of flight $\Delta t$, Lambert's problem seeks the connecting orbit. Using universal variables $\chi$ and $z = \alpha \chi^2$ ($\alpha = 1/a$):
\Delta t = \frac{\chi^3}{\sqrt{\mu}} S(z) + \frac{\mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}_2}{\sqrt{\mu}} \chi^2 C(z) + \sqrt{\frac{r_1 r_2}{\mu}} \chi \left[ 1 - z S(z) \right]


where $S(z), C(z)$ are Stumpff functions:
C(z) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1 - \cos\sqrt{z}}{z} & z > 0 \\
\frac{1 - \cosh\sqrt{-z}}{-z} & z < 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & z = 0
\end{cases}


S(z) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sqrt{z} - \sin\sqrt{z}}{(\sqrt{z})^3} & z > 0 \\
\frac{\sinh\sqrt{-z} - \sqrt{-z}}{(\sqrt{-z})^3} & z < 0 \\
\frac{1}{6} & z = 0
\end{cases}

2.2.2 Porkchop Plots

A porkchop plot visualizes $C_3$ and arrival $v_\infty$ contours over departure/arrival date pairs $(t_{\text{dep}}, t_{\text{arr}})$. Local minima in $C_3$ correspond to optimal launch windows; gradient $\nabla C_3$ indicates sensitivity to timing—a critical factor for mission robustness.

Key Equation Box 2.2: Lambert Solution Summary

· Transfer angle: $\cos \theta = (\mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}_2)/(r_1 r_2)$
· Universal anomaly $\chi$ solves time equation above
· Porkchop contours: $C_3(t_{\text{dep}}, t_{\text{arr}})$, $v_\infty(t_{\text{dep}}, t_{\text{arr}})$
  Engineering meaning: Identifies feasible launch windows and quantifies timing sensitivity.

2.3 Propellant Depot Logistics and Boil-Off Dynamics

2.3.1 Boil-Off Modeling

Cryogenic propellant boil-off follows energy balance $\dot{m}_{\text{boil}} = (Q_{\text{in}} - Q_{\text{out}})/h_{fg}$. For passive storage:
m(t) = m_0 e^{-t / \tau}, \quad \tau = \frac{m_0 h_{fg}}{UA(T_{\text{env}} - T_{\text{prop}})}


with $U \approx 0.1\text{--}0.5$ W/m²K for multi-layer insulation in space.

2.3.2 Depot Network Logistics

Mass balance for depot $j$: $\dot{m}_j = \sum_i \dot{m}_{i \to j} - \sum_k \dot{m}_{j \to k} - \dot{m}_{\text{boil},j}$. Propellant mass for $\Delta v$ transfer: $m_p = m_{\text{dry}} (e^{\Delta v / (g_0 I_{\text{sp}})} - 1)$.

2.3.3 Stochastic Campaign Modeling

Real campaigns face uncertainty in launch success, boil-off rates, and ISRU yield. We model depot mass $m_j(t)$ as an Itô process:
dm_j = \left( \sum_i \lambda_{i \to j} m_i - \sum_k \lambda_{j \to k} m_j - \beta_j m_j \right) dt + \sigma_j dW_t


where $W_t$ is a Wiener process capturing exogenous variability. The Logistics Readiness Level (LRL) metric quantifies confidence:
\text{LRL}_j(t) = \mathbb{P}\left[ m_j(t) \geq m_{\text{min}} \mid \mathcal{F}_t \right]


where $\mathcal{F}_t$ is the filtration of available information. Tasks in the research-level campaign reasoning family require models to reason about such stochastic constraints.

Key Equation Box 2.3: Stochastic Logistics Essentials

· Boil-off decay: $m(t) = m_0 e^{-t/\tau}$
· Stochastic depot dynamics: $dm_j = (\text{net flow} - \beta_j m_j)dt + \sigma_j dW_t$
· LRL metric: $\text{LRL}_j(t) = \mathbb{P}[m_j(t) \geq m_{\text{min}} \mid \mathcal{F}_t]$
  Engineering meaning: Quantifies logistics reliability under uncertainty; LRL > 0.9 required for crewed missions.

2.4 Radiation Environment and Dose Accumulation

2.4.1 Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) Spectrum

The Badhwar–O'Neill 2020 model gives differential flux for particle type $i$:
\frac{dJ_i}{dE} = \frac{C_i E^{0.3}}{(E + E_0)^{2.7}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(E - E_c)/\Delta E}} \cdot \Phi(t)


with $E_0 = 938$ MeV, $\Phi(t)$ the solar modulation potential.

2.4.2 Solar Particle Events (SPE)

SPEs follow power-law spectra $dJ/dE = J_0 E^{-\gamma}$ ($\gamma \approx 3$) with Poisson arrival rate $\lambda(t)$ peaking at solar maximum.

2.4.3 Shielding and Dose Calculation

Dose rate behind shield thickness $x$:
\dot{D}(x) = \sum_i \int_{E_{\min}}^{\infty} \frac{dJ_i}{dE} \cdot \text{LET}_i(E) \cdot T_i(E, x) \, dE


where $T_i(E,x)$ is transmission probability computed via transport equations.

2.4.4 Mission-Integrated Dose

Total dose: $D_{\text{total}} = \int_{t_{\text{dep}}}^{t_{\text{arr}}} \dot{D}(x(t)) \, dt$, with SPE contributions summed over events.

Key Equation Box 2.4: Radiation Essentials

· GCR flux: Badhwar–O'Neill parameterization above
· SPE: Poisson process with power-law spectrum
· Dose integration: $D_{\text{total}} = \int \dot{D}(x(t)) dt$
  Engineering meaning: Quantifies crew risk; mission design must satisfy $D_{\text{total}} \leq D_{\text{limit}}$ (e.g., 1 Sv career limit).

2.5 In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Mass Flow

2.5.1 Mars Atmospheric ISRU

Sabatier reaction: $\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ with stoichiometric ratios 1 kg CO₂ + 0.18 kg H₂ → 0.36 kg CH₄ + 0.82 kg H₂O. Mass flow rate for reactor power $P$: $\dot{m}_{\text{CH}_4} = \eta P / \Delta H_{\text{reaction}}$ ($\Delta H = 165$ kJ/mol).

2.5.2 Water Extraction from Regolith

Extraction rate: $\dot{m}_{\text{H2O}} = \eta_{\text{extract}} \cdot \dot{m}_{\text{regolith}} \cdot f_{\text{H2O}}$ with $f_{\text{H2O}} \approx 0.01\text{--}0.03$.

2.5.3 Bootstrap Factor

Bootstrap factor $B = m_{\text{propellant produced}} / m_{\text{infrastructure delivered}}$; $B > 1$ indicates net benefit. Growth over missions: $m_p^{(n+1)} = m_p^{(n)} + B \cdot m_{\text{infra}}^{(n)}$.

Key Equation Box 2.5: ISRU Essentials

· Sabatier stoichiometry: mass ratios above
· Extraction rate: $\dot{m}_{\text{H2O}} = \eta_{\text{extract}} \dot{m}_{\text{regolith}} f_{\text{H2O}}$
· Bootstrap factor: $B = m_p / m_{\text{infra}}$
  Engineering meaning: Quantifies ISRU leverage; $B > 3$ required for sustainable Mars campaigns.

2.6 Integrated Campaign-Level Optimization

2.6.1 Multi-Objective Mission Design

Optimization problem:
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \left[ J_1(\mathbf{x}), J_2(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, J_m(\mathbf{x}) \right]


subject to $\Delta v_{\text{total}} \leq \Delta v_{\text{max}}$, $D_{\text{total}} \leq D_{\text{limit}}$, $t_{\text{mission}} \leq t_{\text{max}}$, where $\mathbf{x}$ includes trajectory parameters, depot locations, ISRU capacity, shielding.

2.6.2 Pareto Front Analysis

Non-dominated solutions satisfy: $\nexists \mathbf{x}$ such that $J_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq J_i(\mathbf{x}^*) \forall i$ with strict inequality for at least one $i$.

2.6.3 Uncertainty Quantification

Robust optimization minimizes expected cost subject to chance constraints: $\mathbb{P}[g_j(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0] \geq 1 - \epsilon_j$.

2.6.4 Formalizing Intentional Operators for Anti-Entropic Campaign Reasoning

Definition 2.1 (Intentional Operator $\Box_\phi$). Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the mission state space, $\mathcal{H}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ a task-relevant entropy measure, and $\phi$ a reasoning policy. The intentional operator $\Box_\phi$ bounds entropy growth:
\Box_\phi \mathcal{H}(s_t) \leq \kappa \cdot \mathcal{H}(s_{t-1}) + \epsilon


where:

· $\mathcal{H}(s_t)$ is the entropy of the posterior distribution over mission-critical quantities at time $t$ (e.g., KL-divergence between current and target depot mass distribution, or Shannon entropy over feasible launch windows)
· $\kappa \in [0, 1)$ is the anti-entropic convergence rate (smaller $\kappa$ indicates stronger uncertainty reduction)
· $\epsilon \geq 0$ bounds exogenous shocks (SPEs, launch delays, component failures)

Operationalization: For a depot mass forecasting task, let $p_t(m)$ be the posterior over mass $m$ at time $t$. We define:
\mathcal{H}(s_t) = D_{\text{KL}}\left( p_t(m) \,\|\, p_{\text{target}}(m) \right)


where $p_{\text{target}}$ is the distribution required for mission success. A reasoning process $\phi$ is anti-entropic if it proposes actions that reduce $\mathcal{H}$ at rate $\kappa$.

Concrete Example: Consider a hypothesis-generation task with incomplete porkchop plot and boil-off forecast.

· Non-anti-entropic response (score 0.3): "Radiation risk is high during solar maximum; consider shielding." (Describes risk but proposes no uncertainty-reducing action)
· Anti-entropic response (score 0.9): "Shift departure by +3 days to avoid peak SPE probability (reduces dose uncertainty by 40% per Badhwar–O'Neill model), and pre-position 15 t LH₂ at L₂ to raise LRL from 0.62 to 0.91 (reduces logistics uncertainty by factor $\kappa = 0.35$)." (Proposes actions with quantified uncertainty reduction)

Connection to Rubric: The anti-entropic reasoning dimension in Section 4.5 explicitly scores whether responses satisfy $\Box_\phi \mathcal{H}(s_{t+1}) \leq \kappa \mathcal{H}(s_t) + \epsilon$ for reasonable $\kappa, \epsilon$.

Theoretical Grounding: This formalism connects to active inference (Friston, 2010) and variational free energy minimization, but is specialized to engineering decision-making under resource constraints.

Key Equation Box 2.6: Intentional Operator Essentials

· Anti-entropic bound: $\Box_\phi \mathcal{H}(s_t) \leq \kappa \mathcal{H}(s_{t-1}) + \epsilon$
· Entropy measure: $\mathcal{H}(s_t) = D_{\text{KL}}(p_t \,\|\, p_{\text{target}})$ or Shannon entropy
· Scoring criterion: Responses must propose actions with quantified $\kappa, \epsilon$
  Engineering meaning: Distinguishes descriptive reasoning from uncertainty-reducing reasoning; essential for robust mission design.

1. Multimodal + Mathematical: Unlike APBench (text-only) or ChemBench (multiple-choice), Logistics-MATRIX requires mapping visual artifacts (porkchop contours, depot time-series) directly onto first-principles equations.
2. Stochastic Logistics: Only benchmark incorporating boil-off uncertainty, SPE Poisson events, and ISRU bootstrap dynamics with formal LRL metric.

Multimodal Learning in Engineering: Vision-language models have been applied to microscopy (Lozano et al., 2024) and medical imaging (Chen et al., 2025), but aerospace applications remain perception-focused (spacecraft detection, terrain classification). Logistics-MATRIX requires mechanism-grounded reasoning: linking visual features to engineering meaning via explicit equations.

Systems Engineering & AI: LLMs have been applied to requirements analysis (Smith et al., 2024) and trade-study generation (Jones & Lee, 2025), but treat engineering knowledge as text-only. Our work explicitly grounds reasoning in multimodal mission artifacts while providing the equations that should underpin such reasoning.

4. Logistics-MATRIX Benchmark Design

4.1 Design Principles and Scope

Logistics-MATRIX is designed according to five principles:

1. Mathematical Grounding: Every task is traceable to equations in Section 2; correct reasoning requires application of formal principles.
2. Multimodal Integration: Visual artifacts paired with explanatory text enable evaluation of cross-modal representational transfer.
3. Open-Ended Evaluation: Rubric-based scoring assesses reasoning quality, not just answer correctness.
4. Modularity: Tasks can be used independently or combined, supporting flexible experimental designs.
5. Reproducibility: All artifacts generated from open-source tools with documented procedures.

Scope: Earth–Mars interplanetary missions including orbital transfers, propellant logistics, radiation exposure, and ISRU operations. The formal task definition framework supports extension to lunar, asteroid, or outer-planet missions.

4.2 Task Families: Formal Definitions with Concrete Examples

Each task is specified by the tuple $(T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$:

· $T$: Task type and query

   rearrange to obtain v² = μ(2/r - 1/a). For elliptical transfers (a > 0), 
   this implies lower launch energy (C₃) but longer time of flight; 
   hyperbolic transfers (a < 0) enable faster transit but require higher C₃. 
   For a Mars mission with C₃ limit 25 km²/s², the vis-viva equation 
   constrains feasible departure dates to the porkchop plot regions 
   where C₃ contours lie below this threshold..."

4.2.4 Simulation Interpretation

Formal definition: $\mathcal{T}_{\text{sim}} = (I, c, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R})$

Concrete Example (Simulation Task)

Type: simulation_interpretation
Artifact: [Image: porkchop_plot_2033.png showing C₃ contours for Starship-class vehicle;
           Parameters: {vehicle: "Starship", LEO_capacity: 150t, max_C3: 120 kJ/kg}]
Context: "Mission: 4-crew Mars surface stay, 500-day total duration.

        the trade-offs between launch energy (C₃), time of flight, and radiation exposure."
Relevant Equations: [lambert, vis_viva, C3_definition, radiation_dose_integration]
Rubric Dimensions: [feature_identification, mechanistic_mapping, actionability, cross_modal_consistency]
Reference Answer Excerpt:
  "The porkchop plot shows two low-C₃ regions: (1) lower-left corner 
   (t_dep=2033.2, t_arr=2033.8) with C₃≈18 kJ/kg and TOF≈200 days; 
   (2) upper-right region (t_dep=2033.6, t_arr=2034.3) with C₃≈22 kJ/kg 
   and TOF≈250 days. Region (1) minimizes launch energy but has steeper 
   C₃ gradient (∂C₃/∂t_dep = -2.1 kJ/kg/day), indicating high sensitivity 
   to launch timing (±2 days requires ±4.2 kJ/kg margin). Radiation dose 
   integration along the region (1) trajectory gives D_total=0.68 Sv vs. 
   0.52 Sv for region (2) due to longer exposure. Recommendation:

   if launch vehicle performance is well-characterized and timing precision 
   can be guaranteed..."
```

Evaluation: Responses must identify visual features (contour gradients, local minima) and map them to engineering quantities ($\Delta v$, dose accumulation) using appropriate equations.

4.3 Mathematical Formalization of Tasks

The evaluation function $E: \text{Response} \times (T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G}) \to [0,1]^d$ maps a model's response to a $d$-dimensional score vector. For hypothesis tasks, the anti-entropic dimension explicitly checks:
\text{score}_{\text{anti-entropic}} = \begin{cases} 
1.0 & \text{if response proposes actions with } \kappa \leq 0.5 \text{ and } \epsilon \leq 0.1 \\
0.75 & \text{if } \kappa \leq 0.7 \text{ or } \epsilon \leq 0.2 \\
0.5 & \text{if mentions uncertainty reduction but no quantification} \\
0.25 & \text{if describes risks but no mitigation} \\
0.0 & \text{if ignores uncertainty}
\end{cases}

4.4 Dataset Curation and Alignment Pipeline

Six-stage pipeline:

1. Source Identification: Open-access mission papers, NASA reports, graduate coursework, self-generated simulations using GMAT, NAIRAS, custom ISRU models.
2. Artifact Extraction: Docling for figure/caption extraction; heuristic filtering (caption ≥200 chars, single-figure focus).
3. Mathematical Annotation: Keyword matching + expert review maps artifacts to equations (e.g., porkchop plot → {lambert, vis_viva, C3, radiation_dose}).
4. Explanation Augmentation: Detailed explanations linking visual features to mathematical principles; each must reference ≥2 equations and ≥1 observable feature.
5. Alignment Verification: Judge model verifies explanation references observable features; human experts review stratified sample.
6. Quality Control: Removal of ambiguous examples, terminology standardization, mathematical correctness validation.

Validation Plan: All porkchop plots cross-checked against NASA Trajectory Browser 2026–2040 Mars windows (C₃ < 25 km²/s² windows must match published data within 5% tolerance). Depot time-series validated against analytical boil-off solutions; radiation maps validated against NAIRAS reference runs.

4.5 Evaluation Protocol and Rubric Design

4.5.1 Scoring Scale and Core Dimensions

Scoring Scale: Responses scored on 0–1 scale with intermediate values {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0} for fine-grained assessment.

Core Rubric Dimensions:

Dimension 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0
Correctness/Plausibility Factually wrong Major errors Partial correct Mostly correct Fully correct / scientifically plausible
Mathematical Rigor No math Incorrect equations Some correct equations Mostly correct derivation Complete, correct derivation with engineering interpretation
Mechanistic Linkage No connection Vague Some linkage Clear linkage Explicit mapping from visual features to equations
Actionability Irrelevant Generic Specific but vague Concrete recommendation Detailed, quantified plan with trade-off analysis

Anti-Entropic Reasoning Dimension (hypothesis tasks only):

Score Uncertainty Handling Quantification of κ, ε
1.0 Proposes actions that actively reduce uncertainty Provides quantified κ ≤ 0.5, ε ≤ 0.1 with justification
0.75 Proposes uncertainty-reducing actions Provides κ ≤ 0.7 or ε ≤ 0.2
0.5 Mentions uncertainty reduction No quantification of κ, ε
0.25 Describes risks but no mitigation No uncertainty reduction proposal
0.0 Ignores uncertainty N/A

4.5.2 Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline

The evaluation pipeline combines objective numerical validation, LLM-judge scoring, and human calibration.

Objective Sub-scores: For tasks with quantifiable outputs (e.g., $\Delta v$, LRL, dose), we compare model-provided numbers against ground truth from GMAT/NAIRAS solvers. Score = 1.0 if within 5% tolerance, 0.5 if within 15%, 0.0 otherwise.

LLM-Judge Scoring: Two specialized judge prompts are used for hypothesis generation (HYP) and simulation interpretation (SIM) tasks, respectively. These prompts are designed to assess anti-entropic reasoning and mechanistic mapping according to the rubric dimensions. The full prompts are provided in Section 4.5.4.

Human Calibration: To ensure LLM-judge scores correlate with expert judgment, we perform a calibration study. Fifty responses (10 per task family) are independently scored by two aerospace engineering experts using the rubric. The experts follow the Expert Calibration Protocol detailed below. The LLM judge is then calibrated to achieve a Spearman correlation $\rho \geq 0.85$ with the average expert scores. Disagreements are analyzed and rubric refinements applied iteratively.

4.5.3 Expert Calibration Protocol

Objective: Train expert reviewers to score the anti-entropic reasoning dimension with high consistency (target inter-rater Spearman $\rho \geq 0.85$).

Mental Model: Experts are instructed to evaluate responses as if they were a Mission Director reviewing a flight proposal. The focus is on whether the response proposes an uncertainty-reducing control policy $\phi$, not merely describes the existing entropy.

· Descriptive Reasoning (score ≤ 0.25): The response identifies risks (e.g., "boil-off variance is high") but does not propose actions to bound entropy. It acts as an "entropy observer."
· Active Reasoning (score ≥ 0.75): The response proposes specific, physically feasible actions that directly reduce uncertainty, ideally with quantified $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$.

Three-Point Evidence Check: Before awarding a score ≥ 0.75, experts must verify three anchors:

1. Mechanistic Anchor: Does the response correctly cite relevant physics (e.g., Badhwar–O'Neill for radiation, Sabatier stoichiometry for ISRU)?
2. Visual Anchor (for SIM tasks): Does the response reference specific visual features (coordinates, contour gradients) from the provided artifact?
3. Stochastic Anchor: Does the response mention confidence intervals, probabilities, or explicitly bound uncertainty using $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$?

Calibration Worksheet:

Dimension Reviewer Question Evidence Required
Grounding Did the model hallucinate trajectory data? Cross-check against GMAT ground-truth metadata.
Mathematical Rigor Is the $\Delta v$ or LRL calculation within 5%? Use the Objective Validator script.
Anti-Entropy Is the proposed mitigation $\phi$ physically feasible? Verify mass-balance and bootstrap factor constraints.

Experts are trained on a set of 10 example responses with known scores until their ratings converge.

5.5 Alignment Disruption Protocol (ADP)

To verify that models are genuinely grounding their reasoning in visual artifacts rather than relying on textual priors, we implement an Alignment Disruption Protocol. This protocol applies three perturbations to task inputs and measures the resulting drop in performance, quantified as the Grounding Delta $\Delta_G$.

5.5.1 Perturbation Types

1. The "Blind" Control (Text-Only)
   · Action: Remove the visual artifact entirely.
   · Goal: Establish baseline $S_{\text{text}}$ of what the model can infer from mission parameters alone.
   · Interpretation: High score on this control suggests reliance on memorized NASA reports rather than visual reasoning.
2. The "Semantic Swap" (Image-Query Mismatch)
   · Action: Pair a query about a specific mission window (e.g., 2033 launch) with a porkchop plot from a different year (e.g., 2035). The swap target is specified in the alignment_control.swap_target_id field.
   · Goal: Test whether the model actually parses axes and numerical values.
   · Failure Mode: Model describes the correct window from memory while ignoring the mismatched image.
   · Score: $S_{\text{swap}}$.
3. The "Equation Erasure" (Mathematical Ablation)
   · Action: Remove the relevant_equations list from the prompt.
   · Goal: Assess if the model can retrieve appropriate physics (e.g., Lambert's problem) autonomously or if it requires explicit hinting.
   · Score: $S_{\text{ablation}}$.

5.5.2 Grounding Delta Calculation

For a model to be considered mechanism-grounded, its performance must degrade significantly when alignment is disrupted. We define:

\Delta_G = \frac{S_{\text{aligned}} - \min(S_{\text{swap}}, S_{\text{text}})}{S_{\text{aligned}}}

where $S_{\text{aligned}}$ is the score on the original aligned task. A low $\Delta_G$ (e.g., $< 0.3$) indicates the model is a "stochastic parrot" that performs well even without the image or with mismatched data. A high $\Delta_G$ confirms genuine visual grounding.

5.5.3 Expected Behavior Table

Perturbation Expected Behavior of Grounded AI Expected Behavior of Pattern-Matching AI
Image Swap Should flag discrepancy: "The provided plot shows 2035, but the query asks for 2033. Cannot answer." Answers the 2033 query using features from the wrong image.
Text-Only Performance drops significantly; may still produce plausible but less precise reasoning. Performance remains high; repeats memorized facts.
Equation Erasure May still recall correct equations but with less precision. Fails to produce any mathematically grounded reasoning.

The ADP is automated within the evaluation toolkit, using the alignment_control field to trigger the appropriate swap.

6. Discussion

6.1 Theoretical Contributions

Logistics-MATRIX establishes mathematical and architectural foundations for evaluating multimodal reasoning in interplanetary systems engineering:

· Unified mathematical framework: First comprehensive compilation of interplanetary logistics equations for AI research, with stochastic extensions and intentional operator theory.
· Formal task definitions: Precise $(T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$ specifications enabling reproducible evaluation and clear separation of reasoning dimensions.
· Anti-entropic evaluation criterion: Operational definition of $\Box_\phi$ provides mathematical basis for assessing uncertainty-reducing reasoning—essential for robust mission design.
· Hybrid evaluation pipeline: Combines objective numerical validation with rubric-based reasoning assessment, addressing limitations of pure LLM-judge approaches.
· Alignment disruption protocol: Systematic stress tests isolate genuine visual grounding from textual priors, providing a quantitative measure ($\Delta_G$) of mechanism-grounded reasoning.

6.2 Limitations

· Patched-conic approximation: Used for computational tractability; future extensions will incorporate n-body dynamics and low-thrust trajectories.
· Dataset scale: 300+ expert-vetted pairs prioritizes quality over quantity; larger curation efforts could improve robustness.
· Modalities covered: Focus on four visualization types; future extensions could add thermal models, communication link budgets, or crew health metrics.
· Evaluation reliance on LLM judges: While calibrated against experts ($\rho \geq 0.85$ target), human evaluation remains gold standard for high-stakes assessment.

6.3 Ethical Considerations

· No real mission data: All artifacts generated from public sources or self-generated simulations; no classified or sensitive information included.
· Explicit scope limitation: Do not use for flight-critical decisions without human oversight and systems engineering review. Benchmark evaluates reasoning quality, not operational readiness.
· Open science commitment: CC BY 4.0 licensing ensures transparency and enables community scrutiny.
· Bias mitigation: Task curation includes diverse mission architectures and explicit consideration of failure modes to avoid over-optimistic reasoning patterns.

7. Conclusion and Open Release

We have presented the theoretical foundations and design of Logistics-MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for reasoning in interplanetary systems engineering. The benchmark is grounded in rigorous mathematical models of orbital mechanics, propellant logistics, radiation environments, ISRU processes, and stochastic campaign optimization. We provided formal task definitions $(T, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$, dataset specifications, and evaluation protocols that enable systematic study of vision–language models' ability to reason about engineering artifacts.

The integration of intentional operator theory provides a novel criterion for evaluating whether reasoning processes actively reduce uncertainty—a property essential for robust mission design under severe resource constraints. By requiring explicit linkage between visual features and mathematical principles, Logistics-MATRIX tests mechanism-grounded reasoning rather than superficial pattern matching. The alignment disruption protocol further ensures that observed performance reflects genuine visual grounding.

The benchmark is designed to support a wide range of empirical investigations: from assessing current VLMs on simulation interpretation tasks, to studying cross-modal transfer effects, to developing new training methods that enhance anti-entropic reasoning. We invite the community to use, extend, and critique Logistics-MATRIX as we collectively work toward AI systems that can genuinely assist in the complex engineering challenges of interplanetary exploration.

Appendices

Appendix A: Detailed Derivations of Orbital Mechanics Equations

A.1 Derivation of the Vis-Viva Equation

Starting from conservation of specific mechanical energy and specific angular momentum in the two-body problem.

Specific mechanical energy:
\mathcal{E} = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = \text{constant}

Specific angular momentum:
\mathbf{h} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v}, \quad h = |\mathbf{h}| = \text{constant}

For any Keplerian orbit, the relationship between semi-major axis $a$ and energy is:
\mathcal{E} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}

This can be derived from the geometry of an ellipse: at periapsis, $r_p = a(1-e)$, $v_p = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a}\frac{1+e}{1-e}}$. Substituting into the energy equation yields $\mathcal{E} = -\mu/(2a)$. For hyperbolas, $a$ is negative.

Equating the two expressions for $\mathcal{E}$:
\frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{2a}

Multiply by 2:
v^2 - \frac{2\mu}{r} = -\frac{\mu}{a}

Rearrange:
v^2 = \frac{2\mu}{r} - \frac{\mu}{a} = \mu\left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)

This is the vis-viva equation.

A.2 Derivation of Sphere of Influence Radius

The sphere of influence (SOI) of a smaller body (mass $m$) orbiting a larger primary (mass $M$) is defined as the region where the gravitational perturbation from the smaller body dominates over that of the primary. Laplace derived the radius using ratios of perturbing accelerations.

Consider a spacecraft at distance $r$ from the smaller body. The acceleration due to the smaller body is $a_m = \mu_m / r^2$, where $\mu_m = Gm$. The perturbing acceleration from the primary (the Sun) on the spacecraft relative to the smaller body is approximately $a_{\text{pert}} \approx (\mu_M / R^2) \cdot (r/R)$ where $R$ is the distance from primary to smaller body. This comes from the tidal force: $\Delta a \approx (2\mu_M r)/R^3$.

Setting $a_m = a_{\text{pert}}$:
\frac{\mu_m}{r^2} = \frac{2\mu_M r}{R^3}

Solve for $r$:
r^3 = \frac{\mu_m}{2\mu_M} R^3


r = \left(\frac{\mu_m}{2\mu_M}\right)^{1/3} R

More accurate derivations give:
r_{\text{SOI}} \approx a \left(\frac{m}{M}\right)^{2/5}


where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the smaller body's orbit. This is the formula used in patched-conic approximations.

A.3 Derivation of Gravity Assist Delta-V

In a gravity assist, the spacecraft approaches a planet with hyperbolic excess velocity $\mathbf{v}_\infty^-$ (in the planet's frame) and leaves with $\mathbf{v}_\infty^+$ such that $|\mathbf{v}_\infty^+| = |\mathbf{v}_\infty^-| = v_\infty$ (conservation of energy in the planet frame). The velocity vector rotates by an angle $\delta$.

From the geometry of a hyperbola, the turning angle $\delta$ satisfies:
\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{e}


where $e$ is the eccentricity of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola, $e = 1 + \frac{r_p v_\infty^2}{\mu}$, with $r_p$ the periapsis distance and $\mu$ the planet's gravitational parameter. Thus:
\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{r_p v_\infty^2}{\mu}}

The change in velocity in the heliocentric frame is:
\Delta \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_\infty^+ - \mathbf{v}_\infty^-


Since the magnitudes are equal, $|\Delta \mathbf{v}| = 2 v_\infty \sin(\delta/2)$. The direction is perpendicular to the bisector of the angle between $\mathbf{v}_\infty^-$ and $\mathbf{v}_\infty^+$.

Appendix B: Lambert's Problem and Universal Variables

B.1 Derivation of Lambert's Time Equation

Lambert's problem: Given two position vectors $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ and the time of flight $\Delta t$, find the orbit connecting them. The solution is based on the geometry of the transfer ellipse and Kepler's equation.

Let $r_1 = |\mathbf{r}_1|$, $r_2 = |\mathbf{r}_2|$, and $c = |\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1|$ (the chord length). Define $s = (r_1 + r_2 + c)/2$. Then the semi-major axis $a$ of the transfer orbit satisfies:
\Delta t = \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{\mu}} \left[ (\alpha - \sin\alpha) - (\beta - \sin\beta) \right] \quad \text{(elliptic case)}


where
\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{s}{2a}}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{s - c}{2a}}

For hyperbolic transfers, similar formulas involve hyperbolic functions.

The universal variable formulation avoids the need for separate cases. Define the universal anomaly $\chi$ and the parameter $z = \alpha \chi^2$, where $\alpha = 1/a$ (positive for ellipses, negative for hyperbolas). The time equation becomes:
\Delta t = \frac{\chi^3}{\sqrt{\mu}} S(z) + \frac{\mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}_2}{\sqrt{\mu}} \chi^2 C(z) + \sqrt{\frac{r_1 r_2}{\mu}} \chi \left[ 1 - z S(z) \right]

The Stumpff functions $C(z)$ and $S(z)$ are defined as:
C(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-z)^k}{(2k+2)!}, \quad S(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-z)^k}{(2k+3)!}


They can be expressed in closed form:
C(z) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1 - \cos\sqrt{z}}{z} & z > 0 \\
\frac{\cosh\sqrt{-z} - 1}{-z} & z < 0 \\
\frac{1}{2} & z = 0
\end{cases}


S(z) = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sqrt{z} - \sin\sqrt{z}}{(\sqrt{z})^3} & z > 0 \\
\frac{\sinh\sqrt{-z} - \sqrt{-z}}{(\sqrt{-z})^3} & z < 0 \\
\frac{1}{6} & z = 0
\end{cases}

B.2 Proof of Convergence of Universal Variable Iteration

To solve Lambert's problem, we need to find $\chi$ such that the time equation holds. Define the function:
F(\chi) = \frac{\chi^3}{\sqrt{\mu}} S(z) + \frac{\mathbf{r}_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}_2}{\sqrt{\mu}} \chi^2 C(z) + \sqrt{\frac{r_1 r_2}{\mu}} \chi \left[ 1 - z S(z) \right] - \Delta t

Newton's method can be applied. The derivative $F'(\chi)$ is well-behaved for all $\chi$. Convergence is guaranteed for initial guesses sufficiently close to the root. In practice, starting with $\chi = \sqrt{\mu} \Delta t / (r_1 + r_2)$ works well. The iteration converges quadratically.

B.3 Derivation of Porkchop Plot Contours

Given a grid of departure dates $t_1$ and arrival dates $t_2$, for each pair we solve Lambert's problem to obtain the required departure $C_3 = v_{\infty,1}^2$ and arrival $v_{\infty,2}$. These values are then contoured. The contours satisfy:
C_3(t_1, t_2) = \text{constant}, \quad v_{\infty,2}(t_1, t_2) = \text{constant}

Local minima in $C_3$ correspond to Hohmann-like transfers. The gradient $\nabla C_3$ indicates sensitivity to launch timing.

Appendix C: Stochastic Logistics and Itô Process Formulation

C.1 Derivation of Boil-Off Exponential Decay

From energy balance: heat input $Q_{\text{in}}$ causes propellant vaporization. The rate of mass loss is:
\dot{m} = -\frac{Q_{\text{in}}}{h_{fg}}


where $h_{fg}$ is latent heat. For passive storage, $Q_{\text{in}} = UA(T_{\text{env}} - T_{\text{prop}})$, assumed constant. Then:
\dot{m} = -\frac{UA(T_{\text{env}} - T_{\text{prop}})}{h_{fg}}


This is constant, so mass decreases linearly. However, as mass decreases, surface area $A$ may change (if tank is not isothermal). A more accurate model assumes that heat flux is proportional to remaining mass (if tank geometry is fixed and propellant fills the tank, area scales as $m^{2/3}$, but often a linear approximation is used: $Q_{\text{in}} \propto m$, leading to exponential decay. The justification: for a spherical tank, area $A \propto V^{2/3} \propto m^{2/3}$. The differential equation becomes $\dot{m} = -k m^{2/3}$, which integrates to a power law. But many engineering models use exponential for simplicity, calibrated to detailed thermal analysis.

Assuming $\dot{m} = -\beta m$, we have $dm/dt = -\beta m$, so $m(t) = m_0 e^{-\beta t}$. The time constant $\tau = 1/\beta$.

C.2 Itô Process for Depot Mass with Uncertainty

We model depot mass $m(t)$ as an Itô diffusion:
dm = \mu(m,t) dt + \sigma(m,t) dW_t


where $W_t$ is a Wiener process. The drift term represents deterministic net flow minus boil-off:
\mu(m,t) = \sum_i \lambda_{i \to j} m_i - \sum_k \lambda_{j \to k} m - \beta m


The diffusion term $\sigma$ captures uncertainty in transfer rates and boil-off. For simplicity, we take $\sigma = \sigma_0 m$ (multiplicative noise) or constant.

The solution to this SDE can be obtained via Itô's lemma. For $\mu = \alpha m$, $\sigma = \sigma m$, the process is geometric Brownian motion:
dm = \alpha m dt + \sigma m dW_t


with solution:
m(t) = m_0 \exp\left( (\alpha - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t + \sigma W_t \right)

C.3 Derivation of Logistics Readiness Level (LRL)

LRL is defined as the probability that the depot mass remains above a minimum threshold $m_{\text{min}}$ at a future time $t$, given current information:
\text{LRL}(t) = \mathbb{P}[m(t) \geq m_{\text{min}} \mid \mathcal{F}_0]


where $\mathcal{F}_0$ is the current information set. If $m(t)$ is lognormally distributed (as in geometric Brownian motion), then:
\ln m(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \ln m_0 + (\alpha - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t,\ \sigma^2 t \right)


Thus:
\text{LRL}(t) = \Phi\left( \frac{\ln(m_0/m_{\text{min}}) + (\alpha - \sigma^2/2) t}{\sigma \sqrt{t}} \right)


where $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF. This quantifies logistics confidence.

Appendix D: Radiation Transport and Dose Calculation

D.1 Derivation of Badhwar–O'Neill GCR Spectrum

The Badhwar–O'Neill model (2020 update) parameterizes the differential flux of GCR particles as:
J(E) = \frac{C E^{0.3}}{(E + E_0)^{2.7}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(E - E_c)/\Delta E}} \cdot \Phi(t)


where $E$ is kinetic energy per nucleon (MeV/n), $E_0 = 938$ MeV (proton rest energy), $E_c$ and $\Delta E$ are solar modulation parameters, and $\Phi(t)$ is the solar modulation potential. The first factor accounts for the interstellar spectrum, the second for solar modulation cutoff.

The derivation is empirical, fitted to AMS-02 and PAMELA data. The exponential cutoff term models the heliospheric shielding.

D.2 Stopping Power and LET

Linear Energy Transfer (LET) is the energy deposited per unit path length. For heavy charged particles, Bethe-Bloch formula gives:
-\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{4\pi e^4 z^2}{m_e v^2} n Z \left[ \ln\left(\frac{2m_e v^2}{I}\right) - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right]


where $ze$ is particle charge, $v$ speed, $n$ number density of electrons in medium, $Z$ atomic number, $I$ mean excitation potential. LET is approximately constant over a wide energy range for GCR.

D.3 Transmission Probability and Shielding

The transmission probability $T_i(E, x)$ for a particle of type $i$ and energy $E$ through a shield of thickness $x$ (g/cm²) is given by:
T_i(E, x) = \exp\left( -\int_0^x \Sigma_i(E, x') dx' \right)


where $\Sigma_i$ is the macroscopic cross section (interaction probability per unit length). For thin shields, continuous slowing-down approximation (CSDA) is used: the particle loses energy continuously, and transmission requires that its range $R(E) > x$. The range-energy relation is $R(E) = \int_0^E \frac{dE'}{S(E')}$ with $S(E)$ stopping power. Then $T_i(E, x) = 1$ if $R(E) > x$, else 0.

For more accurate calculations, transport equations (Boltzmann) are solved numerically using codes like HZETRN or OLTARIS.

D.4 Dose Integration Over Trajectory

The instantaneous dose rate at time $t$ along a trajectory is:
\dot{D}(t) = \sum_i \int_{E_{\min}}^\infty J_i(E, t) \cdot \text{LET}_i(E) \cdot T_i(E, \text{shielding}(t)) \, dE


where $J_i(E,t)$ depends on solar modulation (which varies with heliocentric distance and time). The total mission dose is:
D_{\text{total}} = \int_{t_{\text{dep}}}^{t_{\text{arr}}} \dot{D}(t) dt + \sum_{\text{SPE events}} D_{\text{SPE}}

For SPEs, each event contributes a dose computed similarly, but with time-dependent flux.

Appendix E: ISRU Mass Balance and Bootstrap Factor Proofs

E.1 Derivation of Sabatier Stoichiometry

Sabatier reaction: $\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$

Molar masses: CO₂ = 44.01 g/mol, H₂ = 2.016 g/mol, CH₄ = 16.04 g/mol, H₂O = 18.015 g/mol.

Thus, 1 mol CO₂ (44.01 g) + 4 mol H₂ (8.064 g) → 1 mol CH₄ (16.04 g) + 2 mol H₂O (36.03 g). Total input mass = 44.01 + 8.064 = 52.074 g; output mass = 16.04 + 36.03 = 52.07 g (conserved). Mass ratios:

· CH₄ / CO₂ = 16.04 / 44.01 ≈ 0.364
· CH₄ / H₂ = 16.04 / 8.064 ≈ 1.989
· H₂O / CO₂ = 36.03 / 44.01 ≈ 0.819
· H₂O / H₂ = 36.03 / 8.064 ≈ 4.47

Also, the required H₂ per kg CO₂ = 8.064 / 44.01 ≈ 0.183 kg.

E.2 Derivation of Bootstrap Factor Growth

Bootstrap factor $B$ is defined as the mass of propellant produced per unit mass of infrastructure delivered. Suppose we deliver $m_i$ kg of ISRU infrastructure. It produces $m_p = B m_i$ kg of propellant. This propellant can be used for subsequent missions, but part may be used to bring more infrastructure. Over multiple missions, the cumulative propellant available grows.

Let $m_p^{(n)}$ be total propellant produced after $n$ missions. Assume each mission adds infrastructure $\Delta m_i$ (delivered from Earth) and uses some propellant for return. A simple model: after first mission, infrastructure $m_i^{(1)}$ produces $B m_i^{(1)}$ propellant. Some of this propellant ($\alpha B m_i^{(1)}$) is used to bring additional infrastructure on the next mission, etc. This leads to exponential growth if $B > 1$.

If we define the effective growth factor $G = 1 + (B-1)\eta$ where $\eta$ is efficiency of using produced propellant for infrastructure delivery, then $m_p^{(n)} \approx m_i^{(0)} G^n$. Detailed derivation requires solving a recurrence.

E.3 Proof of ISRU Feasibility Condition $B > 3$ for Mars Campaigns

For a Mars mission, the propellant required for ascent from Mars surface to orbit and for trans-Earth injection is significant. Typical values: Mars ascent $\Delta v \approx 4.1$ km/s, Earth return $\Delta v \approx 2.1$ km/s from Mars orbit. Using rocket equation with $I_{sp} \approx 380$ s (methane/oxygen), the mass ratio required is $R = \exp(\Delta v / (g I_{sp})) \approx \exp(6200 / (9.81*380)) \approx \exp(1.66) \approx 5.26$. So propellant mass fraction is $(R-1)/R \approx 0.81$. To produce this propellant locally, the ISRU plant must produce 4.2 times the dry mass of the ascent vehicle (if dry mass is 20% of total). If infrastructure mass is comparable to dry mass, $B$ must exceed 4 to make it worthwhile. NASA studies suggest $B > 3$ is the threshold for net benefit.

Appendix F: Intentional Operator Theory and Anti-Entropic Bounds

F.1 Derivation of the KL Divergence as Entropy Measure

Given a posterior distribution $p_t(m)$ over depot mass and a target distribution $p_{\text{target}}(m)$ required for mission success, the Kullback-Leibler divergence is:
D_{\text{KL}}(p_t \| p_{\text{target}}) = \int p_t(m) \ln \frac{p_t(m)}{p_{\text{target}}(m)} dm


This measures the information gain needed to align current knowledge with the target. Reducing $D_{\text{KL}}$ corresponds to reducing uncertainty about meeting requirements.

F.2 Proof That $\Box_\phi$ Implies Active Reasoning

If a reasoning policy $\phi$ satisfies $\Box_\phi \mathcal{H}(s_t) \leq \kappa \mathcal{H}(s_{t-1}) + \epsilon$ with $\kappa < 1$, then after $n$ steps, $\mathcal{H}(s_{t+n}) \leq \kappa^n \mathcal{H}(s_t) + \frac{\epsilon}{1-\kappa}$ (by induction). Thus entropy is bounded and converges to at most $\epsilon/(1-\kappa)$. This formalizes the requirement that reasoning must actively reduce uncertainty, not just describe it.

F.3 Connection to Active Inference

Active inference (Friston) posits that agents act to minimize variational free energy, which is an upper bound on surprise. Here, $\mathcal{H}$ plays a similar role: the agent seeks to align its beliefs with desired outcomes. The intentional operator $\Box_\phi$ is a constraint on the dynamics of that alignment, ensuring that actions (reasoning steps) are effective.

Appendix G: Task Family Reference Examples

G.1 Foundational Task Example (FOUND-001)

Query: Derive the vis-viva equation and explain its implications for choosing between elliptical and hyperbolic transfers for a Mars mission with limited launch energy.

Reference Answer:
Starting from conservation of energy and angular momentum in the two-body problem, we have specific mechanical energy $\mathcal{E} = v^2/2 - \mu/r$ and specific angular momentum $h = r v_\perp$. For any conic section, $\mathcal{E} = -\mu/(2a)$. Equating gives $v^2/2 - \mu/r = -\mu/(2a)$, so $v^2 = \mu(2/r - 1/a)$. This is the vis-viva equation.

For a Mars mission, $C_3 = v_\infty^2$ at Earth departure is the key. For an elliptical transfer ($a > 0$), $C_3$ is relatively low because the spacecraft is captured by the Sun's gravity; typical $C_3$ for a Hohmann transfer is about 8.8 km²/s². For a hyperbolic transfer ($a < 0$), $C_3$ is higher, allowing faster transit but requiring more launch energy. With limited launch energy (e.g., $C_3 \leq 25$ km²/s²), elliptical transfers are preferred, but they impose longer flight times and higher radiation exposure. The vis-viva equation thus constrains feasible departure dates as seen in porkchop plots.

G.2 Campaign Task Example (CAMP-042)

Query: Design a 500-day Mars surface mission with 4 crew, 20 kW nuclear power. Determine optimal ISRU vs. imported propellant mix, accounting for boil-off uncertainty and radiation limits.

Reference Answer:
First, compute $\Delta v$ for each phase: Earth departure, Mars capture, descent, ascent, TEI. Assume $I_{sp}=380$ s. Total $\Delta v \approx 6.2$ km/s. Using rocket equation, initial mass in LEO for all-imported propellant: $m_0 = m_{\text{dry}} e^{\Delta v/(g I_{sp})}$. With dry mass $m_{\text{dry}} = 120$ t (Starship-class), $m_0 = 120 e^{6200/(9.81*380)} = 120 e^{1.66} = 120 \times 5.26 = 631$ t. Propellant mass = $631 - 120 = 511$ t.

ISRU option: deliver infrastructure (reactor, Sabatier plant, excavator) mass $m_{\text{infra}} = 26$ t, plus $12$ t imported H₂ (seed). On Mars, using atmospheric CO₂ and water from regolith, the Sabatier reaction produces CH₄ and H₂O. Electrolysis of water yields H₂ for further reactions. With bootstrap factor $B=3.2$, total propellant produced = $3.2 \times 26 = 83$ t, plus imported H₂ yields total 95 t, enough for ascent and TEI? Recalculate: ascent $\Delta v = 4.1$ km/s from surface to Mars orbit; TEI $\Delta v = 2.1$ km/s from Mars orbit. Combined $\Delta v \approx 6.2$ km/s, so mass ratio still 5.26. For ascent vehicle dry mass 30 t, propellant needed = $30 \times (5.26-1) = 128$ t. ISRU production 83 t is insufficient; must supplement with imported propellant. So optimal mix: ISRU covers 83 t, import 45 t. LEO mass for imported propellant: $45 e^{6.2/(9.81*380)} = 45 \times 5.26 = 237$ t LEO, plus infrastructure 26 t, total 263 t LEO, much less than 631 t.

Boil-off uncertainty: $\beta = 0.002$/day $\pm 30\%$. Monte Carlo simulation (1000 runs) gives LRL for ISRU option = 0.87 ± 0.06 (probability that depot mass stays above minimum). Imported option LRL = 0.94 ± 0.03. Radiation dose along low-C₃ trajectory: using NAIRAS, total dose = 0.72 Sv (below 0.8 Sv limit). Recommend ISRU option with 15% mass contingency for boil-off uncertainty.

G.3 Hypothesis Generation Example (HYP-018)

Query: Given incomplete porkchop plot showing low-C₃ region during solar maximum, propose three mission adaptations to mitigate radiation risk.

Reference Answer:

1. Shift departure by +3 days to avoid peak SPE probability. Using Badhwar–O'Neill model, SPE rate peaks at solar maximum, but shifting by a few days may reduce exposure if the peak is narrow. Quantify: dose uncertainty reduced by 40%, $\kappa = 0.6$.
2. Pre-position 15 t LH₂ at Earth-Moon L2 depot to raise LRL from 0.62 to 0.91. This reduces logistics uncertainty, $\kappa = 0.35$.
3. Add 5 mm aluminum shielding to crew habitat. This increases mass by 2.1 t but reduces dose variance by 60% (from transport calculations). Combined, these actions satisfy $\Box_\phi \mathcal{H} \leq 0.4 \mathcal{H} + 0.05$, indicating strong anti-entropic reasoning.

G.4 Simulation Interpretation Example (SIM-015)

Query: Identify feasible launch windows from porkchop plot and explain trade-offs between launch energy, flight time, and radiation.

Reference Answer:
The porkchop plot shows two low-C₃ regions: (1) lower-left corner (t_dep = 2033.2, t_arr = 2033.8) with C₃ ≈ 18 kJ/kg and TOF ≈ 200 days; (2) upper-right region (t_dep = 2033.6, t_arr = 2034.3) with C₃ ≈ 22 kJ/kg and TOF ≈ 250 days. Region (1) minimizes launch energy but has steeper C₃ gradient (∂C₃/∂t_dep = -2.1 kJ/kg/day), indicating high sensitivity to launch timing (±2 days requires ±4.2 kJ/kg margin). Radiation dose integration along region (1) trajectory gives D_total = 0.68 Sv vs. 0.52 Sv for region (2) due to longer exposure. Recommendation: choose region (2) if radiation margin is critical; choose region (1) if launch vehicle performance is well-characterized and timing precision can be guaranteed.

Appendix H: Expert Calibration Protocol

H.1 Training Material for Experts

Experts are provided with a document explaining the rubric dimensions, the intentional operator concept, and examples of responses at each score level. They undergo a training session where they score 10 sample responses and compare with reference scores. Discrepancies are discussed until consensus is reached.

H.2 Inter-Rater Reliability Calculation

After training, each expert independently scores a set of 50 responses (10 per task family). The scores for each dimension are recorded. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\rho$ is computed between the two experts' scores. If $\rho < 0.85$, the rubric is refined and the process repeated.

H.3 LLM Judge Calibration

The LLM judge is prompted to score the same 50 responses. Its scores are compared to the average expert scores using Spearman correlation. If $\rho < 0.85$, the judge prompt is adjusted (e.g., adding more examples, clarifying instructions). The process continues until the target is met.

Appendix J: Artifact Generation Code Documentation

J.1 Porkchop Plot Generation with GMAT

The script generate_porkchop.py uses NASA's GMAT via Python API. It defines a mission sequence: Earth, Mars, and a spacecraft. For a grid of departure dates (e.g., from 2030 to 2040) and arrival dates (with TOF from 100 to 300 days), it runs Lambert solver and records $C_3$ and $v_\infty$. Contours are plotted using matplotlib.

Key parameters: departure dates, arrival dates, central bodies, ephemeris source (DE430). The script outputs PNG files and a JSON metadata file with min/max values and validation cross-checks against NASA Trajectory Browser.

J.2 Depot Diagrams

generate_depot.py uses NetworkX to create a directed graph of depots (Earth LEO, L1, L2, Mars orbit). Nodes have attributes: initial mass, boil-off rate $\beta$, transfer rates. It simulates the mass evolution over time using the SDE solver (Euler-Maruyama). Outputs time series plots and network visualizations.

J.3 Radiation Maps

generate_radiation.py calls NAIRAS model via API for a given trajectory (ephemeris from GMAT). It computes dose rate at each point, integrates along path, and produces heatmaps of dose vs. departure/arrival dates. Shielding calculations use OLTARIS.

J.4 ISRU Diagrams

generate_isru.py implements Sabatier stoichiometry and mass balance. It outputs Sankey diagrams of mass flow and bootstrap factor calculations.

All generation code is open-source and available in the GitHub repository.
