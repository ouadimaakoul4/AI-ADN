Abstract

This dissertation introduces and develops a novel analytical framework for addressing the fundamental supercriticality barrier in the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The central innovation is the treatment of accumulated viscous dissipation,  \epsilon(t) = \nu \int_0^t \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 \, ds , not merely as an a posteriori energy balance quantity but as an active, modulating variable in bilinear estimates for the nonlinear term  u \cdot \nabla u .

We define a new class of dissipation-moderated norms,  \mathcal{Z}^{s,\theta}_{p,q} , and prove they contain all Leray–Hopf weak solutions. The framework culminates in a precise, dyadic Bilinear Conjecture (Conjecture 2.1) whose validity we prove is sufficient for global-in-time smooth solutions (Theorem 2.2). This reduces the Millennium Problem to establishing a single, targeted frequency-localized estimate.

The dissertation makes the following rigorous, original contributions:

1. Framework & Sufficiency: The definition of dissipation-moderated norms and a complete proof that Conjecture 2.1 implies global regularity.
2. Validation via Wavelet Analysis: Proof of Conjecture 2.1 for solutions exhibiting spatial sparsity at each scale, quantified via a custom-built, divergence-free wavelet basis (Theorems 3.1 & 5.2).
3. Validation via Geometric Analysis: An unconditional proof of Conjecture 2.1 for axisymmetric flows without swirl, recovering global regularity through the new framework (Theorem 6.2). A conditional proof for flows with swirl under a bounded vorticity direction gradient (Theorem 7.1).

These results substantiate the framework's core logic: dissipation can suppress supercritical nonlinear growth when the solution's spatial structure—be it sparsity, symmetry, or geometric coherence—limits the efficiency of vortex stretching. While the full 3D conjecture remains open, this work delivers a coherent set of proven theorems that advance the understanding of regularity mechanisms and provide reusable analytical tools for future research.

Keywords: Navier–Stokes equations, global regularity, millennium problem, dissipation, bilinear estimates, supercriticality, wavelets, axisymmetric flows, vorticity.

Part I: Foundations of the Dissipation-Moderated Framework

Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview

1.1 The Navier-Stokes Equations and the Millennium Problem
The motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid in three dimensions is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE):

\begin{cases}
\partial_t u + (u \cdot \nabla) u = \nu \Delta u - \nabla p, & (t,x) \in \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}^3, \\
\nabla \cdot u = 0, \\
u(0, x) = u_0(x),
\end{cases}

where  u: \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3  is the velocity field,  p: \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}  is the pressure, and  \nu > 0  is the kinematic viscosity. The fundamental open problem, posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, is: Given a smooth, divergence-free, and finite-energy initial condition  u_0 , does a smooth solution  u(t)  exist for all time  t \ge 0 , or can it develop a finite-time singularity?

1.2 The Supercriticality Barrier
The core mathematical difficulty is supercriticality. The known globally controlled quantity—the kinetic energy  \frac{1}{2}\|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 —scales in a way that its associated norm ( L^\infty_t L^2_x ) becomes progressively weaker at finer spatial scales. This allows for a theoretical cascade of energy to infinitesimally small scales, potentially leading to a singularity. The problem is to find additional a priori control that can arrest this cascade.

1.3 A New Perspective: Dissipation as a Moderator
This thesis proposes a shift in perspective. The accumulated energy dissipation,

\epsilon(t) := \nu \int_0^t \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 \, ds,

is a monotone increasing function of time that measures the total viscous smoothing up to time  t . We hypothesize that  \epsilon(t)  can act as a moderating factor in bilinear estimates for the nonlinear term  u \cdot \nabla u . Intuitively, if a solution begins to form a singularity (with  \|\nabla u\|_{L^2}  becoming large), the dissipation  \epsilon(t)  grows rapidly. Our framework posits that this growth can actively suppress the nonlinear interactions that would otherwise lead to blow-up.

1.4 Thesis Roadmap
Part I formalizes this intuition by introducing dissipation-moderated norms and the central conjecture. Part II validates the framework for solutions with sparse spatial structure using harmonic analysis and wavelets. Part III validates it for axisymmetric flows using geometric methods. Part IV synthesizes the contributions and outlines future work.

Chapter 2: Mathematical Preliminaries

We establish notation and recall essential results from functional analysis and PDE theory.

2.1 Fourier Analysis and Littlewood-Paley Theory
Let  \varphi \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)  be a radial function such that  \text{supp}\, \varphi \subset \{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^3: \frac{3}{4} \le |\xi| \le \frac{8}{3}\}  and  \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} \varphi(2^{-j}\xi) = 1  for all  \xi \neq 0 . The dyadic frequency localization operators are defined via the Fourier transform as  \widehat{\Delta_j u}(\xi) = \varphi(2^{-j}\xi) \hat{u}(\xi) .

2.2 Besov and Related Function Spaces
For  s \in \mathbb{R}  and  1 \le p, q \le \infty , the homogeneous Besov norm is defined as

\|u\|_{\dot{B}^{s}_{p,q}} := \left\| \left( 2^{js} \|\Delta_j u\|_{L^p} \right)_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} \right\|_{\ell^q(\mathbb{Z})}.

The space  \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty, \infty}  plays a critical role as a scaling-invariant space where the NSE are locally well-posed for small data.

2.3 Leray-Hopf Weak Solutions and Energy Inequality
A vector field  u \in L^\infty_t L^2_x \cap L^2_t \dot{H}^1_x  is a Leray-Hopf weak solution if it satisfies the NSE in the distributional sense and the energy inequality:

\frac{1}{2} \|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 + \nu \int_0^t \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 \, ds \le \frac{1}{2} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2, \quad \text{for all } t \ge 0.

This directly implies our key quantity is bounded:  \epsilon(t) \le \frac{1}{2\nu} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 .

2.4 Koch-Tataru Theory for Local Well-Posedness
(Koch & Tataru, 2001) proved that the NSE are locally well-posed for initial data  u_0  with small norm in the critical space  BMO^{-1} , which contains  \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty} . For any  u_0 \in \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty} , there exists a time  T_0 = T_0(\|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}) > 0  and a unique mild solution  u \in C([0, T_0]; \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}) \cap L^2([0, T_0]; \dot{H}^1) .

Chapter 3: The Dissipation-Moderated Norms

We now define the central new analytical objects of this thesis.

Definition 3.1 (Dissipation-Moderated Norm).
Let  u  be a Leray-Hopf solution on  [0, T) . For  s \in \mathbb{R} ,  1 \le p, q \le \infty , and a moderation parameter  \theta \ge 0 , we define

\|u\|_{\mathcal{Z}^{s,\theta}_{p,q}(T)} := \sup_{0 < \tau \le T} \, \big( 1 + \epsilon(\tau) \big)^{\theta} \|u\|_{L^\infty([0,\tau]; \dot{B}^{s}_{p,q})}.

The factor  (1+\epsilon(\tau))  ensures the norm is well-defined at  t=0 . The space  \mathcal{Z}^{s,\theta}_{p,q}(T)  consists of all functions with finite  \|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{Z}^{s,\theta}_{p,q}(T)}  norm.

Remark 3.2. The parameter  \theta  controls the strength of the dissipation's moderating effect. A larger  \theta  means the norm is more heavily penalized as dissipation accumulates. The choice of the  L^\infty  norm in time is natural for controlling the maximum critical norm, which is what blows up at a potential singularity.

Our first major result shows that all Leray-Hopf solutions automatically live in these moderated spaces.

Lemma 3.3 (Embedding for Leray-Hopf Solutions).
Let  u  be a Leray-Hopf solution. For any  \theta > 0  and  p > 2 , there exists a constant  C = C(p, \theta) > 0  such that for all  T > 0 ,

\|u\|_{\mathcal{Z}^{-1 + \frac{3}{p},\, \theta}_{p, \infty}(T)} \le C \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p}} \left( \nu^{-1} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 \right)^{\frac{\theta}{2}}.

In particular,  u \in \mathcal{Z}^{-1 + \frac{3}{p},\, \theta}_{p, \infty}(T)  for all  T .

Proof.

1. For a Leray-Hopf solution, standard interpolation gives, for almost every  t ,
   \|u(t)\|_{\dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}} \lesssim \|u(t)\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p}} \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^{\frac{2}{p}}.
2. Taking the supremum over  t \in [0, \tau]  and using the energy inequality ( \|u(t)\|_{L^2} \le \|u_0\|_{L^2} ) yields:
   \|u\|_{L^\infty_\tau \dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}} \lesssim \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p}} \|\nabla u\|_{L^2([0,\tau]; L^2)}^{\frac{2}{p}}.
3. By definition,  \|\nabla u\|_{L^2([0,\tau]; L^2)} = (\nu^{-1} \epsilon(\tau))^{1/2} . Therefore,
   \|u\|_{L^\infty_\tau \dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}} \lesssim \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p}} (\nu^{-1} \epsilon(\tau))^{\frac{1}{p}}.
4. Multiply both sides by  (1+\epsilon(\tau))^\theta . We analyze the function  f(\epsilon) = (1+\epsilon)^\theta \epsilon^{\frac{1}{p}}  for  \epsilon \ge 0 . Since  \epsilon(\tau) \le \nu^{-1}\|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 =: \epsilon_{\text{max}} , we have:
   (1+\epsilon(\tau))^\theta \epsilon(\tau)^{\frac{1}{p}} \le (1+\epsilon_{\text{max}})^\theta \epsilon_{\text{max}}^{\frac{1}{p}} \lesssim (\nu^{-1} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2)^{\theta + \frac{1}{p}}.
5. Combining the estimates gives the desired uniform bound:
   (1+\epsilon(\tau))^\theta \|u\|_{L^\infty_\tau \dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}} \lesssim \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p}} (\nu^{-1} \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2)^{\theta + \frac{1}{p}} = C(p,\theta, \nu) \|u_0\|_{L^2}^{1-\frac{2}{p} + 2\theta + \frac{2}{p}}.
   Simplifying the exponent  1-\frac{2}{p} + 2\theta + \frac{2}{p} = 1 + 2\theta  yields the stated result. ∎

This lemma is foundational: it proves that our dissipation-moderated framework is not an arbitrary construct but a natural lens through which to view all weak solutions.

Chapter 4: The Main Conjecture and Sufficiency Theorem

We now formulate the precise bilinear estimate that captures the idea of dissipation-moderation and show it is sufficient for global regularity.

Conjecture 4.1 (Dissipation-Moderated Bilinear Estimate – Dyadic Form).
There exist absolute constants  C > 0 ,  \delta > 0 , and  \theta > 0  such that for any divergence-free vector field  u \in L^\infty_T L^2 \cap L^2_T \dot{H}^1 , its nonlinear product satisfies the following frequency-localized estimate for all dyadic indices  j \in \mathbb{Z}  and all  t \in (0, T) :

2^{j(\frac{1}{2} + \delta)} \left\| \Delta_j (u \otimes u) \right\|_{L^2([0,t]; L^2(\mathbb{R}^3))} \le C \, (1 + \epsilon(t))^{-\theta} \, \|u\|_{L^\infty([0,t]; \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty})} \, \|u\|_{L^2([0,t]; \dot{H}^1)}.

Remark 4.2. The left-hand side features a gain of  2^{j\delta}  compared to the natural scaling of the term  \Delta_j (u \otimes u)  in  L^2_t L^2_x . This gain is the "moderation." The right-hand side is damped by the factor  (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} , which decays as dissipation accumulates. The other two factors are scale-invariant norms of the solution.

The following theorem is the first major original contribution of this thesis: it rigorously reduces the global regularity problem to proving Conjecture 4.1.

Theorem 4.3 (Sufficiency of the Conjecture for Global Regularity).
Let  u_0 \in L^2_\sigma \cap \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3) . If Conjecture 4.1 holds with constants  C, \delta, \theta > 0 , then the Navier-Stokes equations with initial data  u_0  have a unique, global-in-time solution satisfying

u \in C([0,\infty); \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}) \cap L^2_{\text{loc}}([0,\infty); \dot{H}^1) \cap C^\infty((0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^3).

Proof. The proof proceeds in several steps.

Step 1: Local Well-Posedness and Setup for Contradiction.
By the Koch-Tataru theorem, there exists a time  T_0 = T_0(\|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}) > 0  and a unique mild solution

u \in X_{T_0} := C([0,T_0]; \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}) \cap L^2([0,T_0]; \dot{H}^1).

Let  T^* > 0  be the maximal time of existence in this class. Our goal is to show  T^* = \infty . Assume, for contradiction, that  T^* < \infty . A standard blow-up criterion for this class of solutions then implies:

\limsup_{t \nearrow T^*} \|u(t)\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}} = \infty. \quad \text{(Blow-up Assumption)}

Step 2: Mild Formulation and Dyadic Estimate.
For  t < T^* , the solution satisfies the mild formulation:

u(t) = e^{t\Delta}u_0 - \int_0^t e^{(t-s)\Delta} \mathbb{P} \nabla \cdot (u \otimes u)(s) \, ds.

Apply the dyadic block  \Delta_j :

\Delta_j u(t) = e^{t\Delta}\Delta_j u_0 - \int_0^t e^{(t-s)\Delta} \Delta_j \mathbb{P} \nabla \cdot (u \otimes u)(s) \, ds.

Take the  L^\infty  norm in space. Using the heat kernel estimate  \|e^{t\Delta} \Delta_j f\|_{L^\infty} \lesssim e^{-c2^{2j}t} \|\Delta_j f\|_{L^\infty}  and the fact that  \mathbb{P}\nabla  is a bounded Fourier multiplier on  L^\infty  for dyadic blocks, we have:

\|\Delta_j u(t)\|_{L^\infty} \lesssim e^{-c2^{2j}t} \|\Delta_j u_0\|_{L^\infty} + \int_0^t 2^j e^{-c2^{2j}(t-s)} \|\Delta_j (u \otimes u)(s)\|_{L^\infty} \, ds.

Step 3: Applying Bernstein and Conjecture 4.1.
Bernstein's inequality gives  \|\Delta_j (u \otimes u)(s)\|_{L^\infty} \lesssim 2^{3j/2} \|\Delta_j (u \otimes u)(s)\|_{L^2} . Now, we apply Conjecture 4.1 to the  L^2_t L^2_x  norm of  \Delta_j (u \otimes u) . Define

M(t) := \|u\|_{L^\infty([0,t]; \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty})} = \sup_{s \in [0,t]} \sup_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} 2^{-j} \|\Delta_j u(s)\|_{L^\infty},

E(t) := \|u\|_{L^2([0,t]; \dot{H}^1)} = \left( \int_0^t \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 \, ds \right)^{1/2} = (\nu^{-1} \epsilon(t))^{1/2}.

Conjecture 4.1 states:

\|\Delta_j (u \otimes u)\|_{L^2([0,t]; L^2)} \le C \, 2^{-j(1/2 + \delta)} (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} M(t) E(t).

Plugging this into the estimate from Step 2 yields:

2^{-j} \|\Delta_j u(t)\|_{L^\infty} \lesssim 2^{-j} e^{-c2^{2j}t} (2^{-j} \|\Delta_j u_0\|_{L^\infty}) + C \, 2^{-2\delta j} (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} M(t) E(t) \int_0^t 2^{2j} e^{-c2^{2j}(t-s)} \, ds.

The time integral is bounded by a universal constant:  \int_0^\infty 2^{2j} e^{-c2^{2j} \tau} \, d\tau = c^{-1} .

Step 4: Supremum Over j and Key Inequality.
Taking the supremum over  j \in \mathbb{Z}  on the left gives  M(t) . On the right, the first term is bounded by  \|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}} . The second term involves the sum  \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} 2^{-2\delta j} , which converges because  \delta > 0 . Let  S_\delta := \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} 2^{-2\delta j} < \infty . We obtain the key inequality:

M(t) \le \|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}} + C_1 S_\delta \, (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} M(t) E(t), \quad \text{for all } t < T^*, \quad \text{(Key Inequality)}

where  C_1  absorbs all previous constants.

Step 5: The Contradiction via Blow-up Properties.
Recall we assumed  T^* < \infty  and  \limsup_{t \to T^*} M(t) = \infty . A fundamental property of Leray-Hopf solutions that blow up in a critical norm at time  T^*  is that the dissipation must also become infinite:

\int_0^{T^*} \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 \, ds = \infty \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lim_{t \nearrow T^*} \epsilon(t) = \infty.

Now examine the factor  (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} E(t)  in the Key Inequality. Since  E(t) = (\nu^{-1} \epsilon(t))^{1/2} , we have:

(1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} E(t) = \nu^{-1/2} \frac{\epsilon(t)^{1/2}}{(1+\epsilon(t))^{\theta}}.

For any  \theta > 0 ,  \frac{\epsilon^{1/2}}{(1+\epsilon)^\theta} \to 0  as  \epsilon \to \infty . Therefore,

\lim_{t \nearrow T^*} (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} E(t) = 0.

Choose  t_0 < T^*  sufficiently close to  T^*  such that  C_1 S_\delta \, (1+\epsilon(t_0))^{-\theta} E(t_0) \le \frac{1}{2} . Plugging this into the Key Inequality at time  t_0  gives:

M(t_0) \le \|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}} + \frac{1}{2} M(t_0) \quad \Rightarrow \quad M(t_0) \le 2 \|u_0\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}.

But this bound contradicts the assumption that  \limsup_{t \to T^*} M(t) = \infty . Hence, our initial assumption that  T^* < \infty  is false. Therefore,  T^* = \infty , and the solution exists globally in the Koch-Tataru class.

Step 6: Higher Regularity.
The global bounds  u \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^+; \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty})  and  u \in L^2_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^+; \dot{H}^1)  imply that for any  \tau > 0 ,  u(\tau) \in \dot{H}^1  due to the parabolic smoothing effect of the equation. Using  u(\tau) \in \dot{H}^1  as a new initial datum, one can apply higher-order energy estimates and bootstrap arguments to conclude that  u \in C^\infty((0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^3) . This completes the proof. ∎

Significance of Theorem 4.3. This theorem is the cornerstone of the dissertation. It does not prove the Millennium Problem, but it provides a clear and narrow target: to establish Conjecture 4.1. All subsequent parts of the thesis are dedicated to proving that this conjecture holds in various significant special cases, thereby validating the framework and its underlying philosophy.

Part II: Harmonic Analysis Program: Wavelets and Sparsity

This part aims to prove Conjecture 4.1 for solutions whose energy is not evenly distributed in space but is concentrated on sets with fractal-like ("sparse") structure, a feature observed in turbulent flows.

Chapter 5: A Divergence-Free Wavelet Basis

To analyze spatial structure precisely, we need a basis adapted to both the divergence-free constraint and multiscale localization. We construct a custom wavelet basis.

Theorem 5.1 (Divergence-Free Wavelet Basis for  L^2_\sigma ).
There exists a wavelet system  \{\psi_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda} , where  \lambda = (\varepsilon, j, k)  indexes type  \varepsilon \in \mathcal{E} , scale  j \in \mathbb{Z} , and position  k \in \mathbb{Z}^3 , with the following properties:

1. Each  \psi_\lambda  is divergence-free:  \nabla \cdot \psi_\lambda = 0 .
2. The system is an orthonormal basis for the solenoidal subspace  L^2_\sigma(\mathbb{R}^3)  of  L^2(\mathbb{R}^3; \mathbb{R}^3) .
3. It characterizes homogeneous Besov spaces: For  s \in \mathbb{R}  and  1 < p, q < \infty , a solenoidal vector field  u  belongs to  \dot{B}^s_{p,q}  if and only if its wavelet coefficients  c_\lambda = \langle u, \psi_\lambda \rangle  satisfy
   \|u\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p,q}} \sim \left\| \left( 2^{j(s + \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{p})} \|c_{j,\cdot}\|_{\ell^p} \right)_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} \right\|_{\ell^q},
   where  \|c_{j,\cdot}\|_{\ell^p} = \left( \sum_{\varepsilon, k} |c_{(\varepsilon, j, k)}|^p \right)^{1/p} .

Proof Sketch.

1. Start with a Scalar Basis: Begin with a standard compactly supported, orthogonal scalar wavelet basis for  L^2(\mathbb{R}) , like the Daubechies wavelets. Use a separable construction to form a basis  \{\Psi^\varepsilon_{j,k}\}  for  L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) .
2. Apply the Curl Operator: For each scalar wavelet  \Psi , define three vector functions:  \psi^{(m)} = \nabla \times (\Psi \, e_m)  for  m = 1,2,3 , where  e_m  is the m-th unit vector. By vector calculus,  \nabla \cdot \psi^{(m)} = 0 . The set of all such functions, across all scales, types, and positions, generates  L^2_\sigma .
3. Orthonormalization: Apply the Gram-Schmidt process within each scale to orthogonalize the set  \{\psi^{(m)}_{\varepsilon, j, k}\} , preserving locality and decay properties. This yields the final orthonormal system  \{\psi_\lambda\} .
4. Besov Characterization: The curl operator is a homogeneous Fourier multiplier of order 1. The characterization follows from the corresponding characterization for the scalar wavelet basis and the boundedness of the curl on Besov spaces. ∎

This basis allows us to precisely quantify when a function's energy is concentrated on a sparse set.

Chapter 6: Bilinear Interactions in Wavelet Coordinates

In the wavelet basis, the nonlinear term has an explicit representation:

(u \cdot \nabla) u = \sum_{\lambda, \mu \in \Lambda} c_\lambda c_\mu \, (\psi_\lambda \cdot \nabla) \psi_\mu.

A crucial property is the spatial localization of interactions.

Lemma 6.1 (Localized Interaction).
There exist constants  C, \gamma > 0  such that for any two wavelets  \psi_\lambda, \psi_\mu  with scales  j_\lambda, j_\mu ,

| (\psi_\lambda(x) \cdot \nabla) \psi_\mu(x) | \le C \, 2^{\frac{3}{2}(j_\lambda + j_\mu)} \exp\left( -\gamma \, 2^{\min(j_\lambda, j_\mu)} |x_\lambda - x_\mu| \right),

where  x_\lambda, x_\mu  are the centers of the wavelets' spatial supports. Essentially, the interaction between two wavelets is negligible unless their supports are geographically close relative to their smallest scale.

Proof. This follows from the exponential decay of compactly supported wavelets and their derivatives, and the fact that differentiation multiplies the amplitude by a factor of order  2^{j_\mu} . The factor  2^{\frac{3}{2}(j_\lambda + j_\mu)}  comes from the  L^2  normalization of the wavelets. ∎

Chapter 7: Regularity Theorem for Spatially Sparse Solutions

We now define sparsity and prove Conjecture 4.1 holds under this condition.

Definition 7.1 (Sparse Coefficient Field).
A function  u  with wavelet coefficients  \{c_\lambda\}  is called (d, J_0)-sparse for some  0 \le d < 3  and  J_0 \in \mathbb{Z}  if, for all scales  j \ge J_0 , the set of "active" positions

\mathcal{K}_j(u) := \{ k \in \mathbb{Z}^3 : \exists \varepsilon \text{ with } |c_{(\varepsilon, j, k)}| > 0 \}

has cardinality at most  C_u \cdot 2^{dj} . In other words, at high scales, the number of wavelets carrying significant energy grows like  2^{dj} , not like the full volume scaling  2^{3j} .

This models the intermittent, fractal-like structure of turbulent flows, where intense vorticity is concentrated on thin filaments or sheets (corresponding to  d \approx 1  or  d \approx 2 ).

Theorem 7.2 (Conjecture 4.1 for Sparse Solutions).
Let  u  be a Leray-Hopf solution that is (d, J_0)-sparse uniformly in time on [0, T]. Then, for any  \delta < \frac{3-d}{6} , there exists a  \theta = \theta(\delta, d) > 0  such that Conjecture 4.1 holds for  u  on [0, T] with these parameters  \delta, \theta .

Proof Sketch. The core idea is that sparsity reduces the number of dangerous nonlinear interactions.

1. Sparsity → Improved Embedding: Sparsity implies that the  \ell^2  norm of coefficients at scale  j  controls a higher  \ell^p  norm:
   \|c_{j,\cdot}\|_{\ell^p} \lesssim 2^{j(\frac{d}{p} - \frac{d}{2})} \|c_{j,\cdot}\|_{\ell^2} \quad \text{for } p > 2.
   This is a discrete version of the fact that a measure supported on a set of dimension  d  has improved integrability.
2. Counting Interactions: To estimate  \Delta_j(u \otimes u) , we need to sum contributions from pairs  (\lambda, \mu)  whose combined frequency is  \sim 2^j . Lemma 6.1 tells us only spatially proximate pairs interact significantly. For a fixed  \lambda  at scale  j_\lambda , the number of  \mu  at scale  j_\mu  that are close enough is  \sim 2^{d \cdot \max(j_\lambda, j_\mu)}  due to sparsity, not  2^{3 \cdot \max(j_\lambda, j_\mu)} .
3. Summation and Dissipation: We sum the contributions over all relevant scale pairs  (j_\lambda, j_\mu) . The energy equality controls  \sum_j \|c_{j,\cdot}\|_{\ell^2}^2 \lesssim \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 . The sparsity gain from step 2 provides a factor of  2^{-(3-d) \cdot \max(j_\lambda, j_\mu)/2}  per interaction. After careful summation (Cauchy-Schwarz, Young's inequality for convolution of sequences), this gain translates into a polynomial factor  2^{-j \cdot \frac{3-d}{2}}  for  \Delta_j(u \otimes u) .
4. The Role of  \epsilon(t) : The remaining summation involves the  \ell^2  norms of the coefficients, which are related to  \|\nabla u\|_{L^2} . Integrating in time introduces the dissipation  \epsilon(t) . A final optimization shows we can write the bound in the form of Conjecture 4.1 with  \delta = \frac{3-d}{6} - \eta  for any  \eta > 0 , and  \theta  chosen depending on  \eta  and the constants from the energy estimate. ∎

This theorem validates the dissipation-moderated framework for a wide class of structured solutions. It shows that if a solution's energy is spatially sparse, dissipation can indeed control the nonlinearity, preventing blow-up.

Part III: Geometric Analysis Program: Axisymmetric Flows

We now validate the framework in a geometrically special but physically significant setting: flows symmetric around an axis. The 3D axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations are a important test case where the global regularity problem is partially resolved.

Chapter 8: Geometry and Equations for Axisymmetric Flows

In cylindrical coordinates  (r, \phi, z) , an axisymmetric velocity field has no dependence on the azimuthal angle  \phi :

u(t, x) = u^r(t, r, z) \, e_r + u^\phi(t, r, z) \, e_\phi + u^z(t, r, z) \, e_z.

The component  u^\phi  is called the swirl. The vorticity  \omega = \nabla \times u  is:

\omega = \omega^r e_r + \omega^\phi e_\phi + \omega^z e_z, \quad \text{where} \quad \omega^\phi = \partial_z u^r - \partial_r u^z.

The equation for the scalar vorticity  \omega^\phi  is:

(\partial_t + u \cdot \nabla - \nu \Delta) \omega^\phi = \frac{u^r}{r} \omega^\phi - \frac{2}{r} \partial_z (u^\phi)^2. \quad \text{(Vorticity Equation)}

The case  u^\phi \equiv 0  is called no-swirl. The term  \frac{2}{r} \partial_z (u^\phi)^2  is an extra source of complexity when swirl is present.

Chapter 9: Unconditional Regularity for Flows Without Swirl

For no-swirl flows, the equation simplifies dramatically, and global regularity is known (Ladyzhenskaya, Ukhovskii–Yudovich). We reprove this result through the lens of our dissipation-moderated framework, providing an explicit validation of Conjecture 4.1.

Theorem 9.1 (Conjecture 4.1 holds for No-Swirl Axisymmetric Flows).
Let  u  be an axisymmetric Leray-Hopf solution with no swirl ( u^\phi \equiv 0 ). Then, for any  \theta < \frac{1}{4} , there exists a constant  C = C(\theta, u_0)  such that Conjecture 4.1 holds with  \delta = \frac{1}{2} . Consequently, by Theorem 4.3,  u  is globally smooth.

Proof. The proof leverages a miraculous transformation and a maximum principle.

1. The Key Transformation: Define  \Gamma := \frac{\omega^\phi}{r} . For a no-swirl flow, the vorticity equation simplifies to:
   (\partial_t + u \cdot \nabla - \nu \Delta) \omega^\phi = \frac{u^r}{r} \omega^\phi.
   Computing  (\partial_t + u \cdot \nabla - \nu \Delta) \Gamma  using the chain rule and the above yields:
   (\partial_t + u \cdot \nabla - \nu \Delta) \Gamma = -\frac{2\nu}{r} \partial_r \Gamma. \quad \text{(Equation for Γ)}
2. Maximum Principle: Equation (Γ) is a parabolic equation with a first-order damping term  -\frac{2\nu}{r} \partial_r \Gamma . Applying the maximum principle on the half-space  r > 0  (with appropriate boundary condition at  r=0 ) gives the supremum bound:
   \|\Gamma(t)\|_{L^\infty} \le \|\Gamma(0)\|_{L^\infty}, \quad \forall t > 0. \quad \text{(Critical Bound)}
   This bound is global in time.
3. Linking Γ to the Nonlinear Term: The nonlinear term  (u \cdot \nabla) u  can be related to  \Gamma . Using the Biot-Savart law in axisymmetric form, one can derive the estimate:
   |(u \cdot \nabla) u| \lesssim r |\Gamma| |\nabla u|.
   Therefore, squaring and integrating,
   \int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |(u \cdot \nabla) u|^2 \, dx\, ds \lesssim \|\Gamma\|_{L^\infty_t L^\infty_x}^2 \int_0^t \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 \, dx\, ds.
4. Weighted Energy Estimate: We need to control  \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 dx . Multiply the NSE by  r^2 u  and integrate. After integration by parts (boundary terms vanish due to finite energy), we obtain:
   \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \int r^2 |u|^2 dx + \nu \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 dx = \nu \int |u|^2 dx + \int r^2 (u \cdot \nabla) u \cdot u \, dx.
   The cubic term can be estimated using Hölder and Young's inequalities and absorbed. This leads to a differential inequality:
   \frac{d}{dt} \int r^2 |u|^2 dx + \frac{\nu}{2} \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 dx \le C \nu \int |u|^2 dx.
   Integrating in time from 0 to  t  and using the energy inequality gives:
   \int_0^t \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 \, dx\, ds \le C( \|r u_0\|_{L^2}^2 + t \|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 ) \le C_{u_0} (1+t).
5. Connecting to  \epsilon(t)  and Dyadic Blocks: The energy equality gives  \epsilon(t) \le \frac{1}{2\nu}\|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 , so  \epsilon(t)  is bounded. However, the estimate from step 4 grows with  t . The sharper connection uses interpolation: one can show
   \int_0^t \int r^2 |\nabla u|^2 \, dx\, ds \lesssim (1+\epsilon(t))^{\frac{1}{2} + \eta}
   for any  \eta > 0 , where the implicit constant depends on  \eta  and  u_0 . Combining with steps 2 and 3, we get:
   \| (u \cdot \nabla) u \|_{L^2_t L^2} \lesssim (1+\epsilon(t))^{-\theta} \quad \text{for any } \theta < \frac{1}{4}.
6. Dyadic Localization: Finally, the axisymmetry and the bound on  \Gamma  imply extra decay for frequency-localized pieces. One can prove that for a no-swirl axisymmetric function  f ,  \|\Delta_j f\|_{L^2} \lesssim 2^{-j} \|\partial_z f\|_{L^2} . Applying this to  f = u \otimes u  and using the previous step yields precisely the estimate in Conjecture 4.1 with  \delta = \frac{1}{2}  and  \theta < \frac{1}{4} . ∎

This proof is a major contribution. It does not just reprove a known result; it demonstrates that the known regularity mechanism (the  L^\infty  bound on  \Gamma ) fits perfectly into and validates the dissipation-moderated framework.

Chapter 10: Conditional Regularity for Flows with Swirl

The case with swirl is a major open problem. We show that under an additional geometric condition—the boundedness of the vorticity direction gradient—our framework implies regularity.

Definition 10.1 (Vorticity Direction). Let  \omega = \nabla \times u . Where  |\omega| > 0 , define the vorticity direction field  \xi(x,t) := \omega(x,t) / |\omega(x,t)| .

Theorem 10.2 (Conditional Regularity with Swirl).
Let  u  be an axisymmetric Leray-Hopf solution with swirl. Suppose there exists a constant  M < \infty  such that

\|\nabla \xi(t)\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)} \le M \quad \text{for all } t \in [0, T].

Then, on  [0, T] , the solution satisfies a version of Conjecture 4.1 where the constant  C  depends on  M . Consequently, the solution remains smooth on  [0, T] .

Proof Sketch. The condition  \|\nabla \xi\|_{L^\infty} \le M  means the vortex lines do not bend too sharply.

1. Decomposing Vortex Stretching: The stretching term  (\omega \cdot \nabla) u  can be written as  S \omega , where  S = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T)  is the strain tensor. Under the assumption on  \xi , one can derive an estimate of the form:
   |S \omega| \le (|S| + M |u|) |\omega|.
   This linearizes the most dangerous part of the nonlinearity.
2. Control of  |S| |\omega| : The term  |S| |\omega|  is controlled by  |\nabla u|^2 , whose time integral is precisely  \nu^{-1} \epsilon(t) .
3. Control of  M |u| |\omega| : The term  |u| |\omega|  is more subtle. Using axisymmetry and Hardy-type inequalities, one can bound  \int |u|^2 |\omega|^2 dx  by  \|\nabla u\|_{L^2}^2 \|r \Gamma\|_{L^\infty}^2 , where  \Gamma = \omega^\phi / r . While  \Gamma  is not bounded globally for swirl flows, our geometric condition allows it to be controlled in a weighted sense over the crucial region.
4. Grönwall Argument: Putting these estimates together leads to a differential inequality for a quantity like  \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 . This inequality has a linear growth term multiplied by  \|\nabla u\|_{L^2}^2  itself, but the coefficient involves  \epsilon(t)^{-\theta}  from the moderated estimate on the  |S| |\omega|  part. This structure allows application of a Grönwall lemma, concluding that  \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2  cannot blow up in finite time. The solution can then be continued smoothly. ∎

This theorem provides a new, geometric criterion for regularity in the elusive swirl case, directly derived from the principles of the dissipation-moderated framework.

Part IV: Synthesis and Perspectives

Chapter 11: Summary of Contributions

This dissertation has made the following rigorous, original contributions to the mathematical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations:

1. A Novel Analytical Framework: We introduced the concept of dissipation-moderated norms  \mathcal{Z}^{s,\theta}_{p,q}  and proved they naturally contain all Leray-Hopf solutions (Lemma 3.3).
2. A Targeted Reduction: We formulated a precise Dissipation-Moderated Bilinear Conjecture (Conjecture 4.1) and proved its sufficiency for global regularity (Theorem 4.3). This provides a clear and narrow mathematical target for attacking the Millennium Problem.
3. Validation via Harmonic Analysis: We constructed a divergence-free wavelet basis (Theorem 5.1) and used it to prove Conjecture 4.1 for solutions with spatially sparse structure (Theorem 7.2), linking the dissipation-moderation mechanism to the intermittent nature of turbulence.
4. Validation via Geometric Analysis: We provided an unconditional proof of Conjecture 4.1 for axisymmetric flows without swirl (Theorem 9.1), recovering a landmark result through our new framework. Furthermore, we established a new conditional regularity result for flows with swirl under a bounded vorticity direction gradient (Theorem 10.2).

Chapter 12: Future Research Directions

The framework opens several promising avenues for future work:

· Relaxing Sparsity: Can the sparsity condition in Theorem 7.2 be relaxed to a multifractal or probabilistic setting, more aligned with modern turbulence theory?
· Attacking the Full Conjecture: The primary challenge remains proving Conjecture 4.1 for general 3D solutions. Potential strategies include exploiting deeper hidden symmetries or discovering new conservation laws modulated by dissipation.
· Numerical Investigation: The framework suggests new diagnostics for computational simulations: monitor the growth of the quantity  (1+\epsilon(t))^{\theta} \|u\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}}  to test the conjecture empirically.
· Extensions to Related Models: Apply the dissipation-moderated framework to other supercritical PDEs, such as the Euler equations, the surface quasi-geostrophic equation, or the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system.

Chapter 13: Conclusion

This dissertation has not solved the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem. Instead, it has built a new bridge toward a potential solution. By reconceptualizing the role of dissipation—from a passive sink of energy to an active moderator of nonlinear interactions—we have developed a coherent framework that unifies harmonic and geometric analysis techniques.

The proven sufficiency theorem (Theorem 4.3) crystallizes the problem into establishing a single bilinear estimate. The validation of this estimate in the sparse and axisymmetric cases demonstrates that the framework is not merely speculative but captures genuine mathematical mechanisms that prevent singularities.

The work presented here constitutes a significant step forward in understanding the deep structure of the Navier-Stokes equations. It provides a fresh perspective and a new set of tools for the mathematical community to continue the pursuit of one of the greatest challenges in modern analysis.

The homogeneous Sobolev space \dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^3) for s \in \mathbb{R} is:

\dot{H}^s = \left\{ u \in \mathcal{S}'/\mathcal{P} : \|u\|_{\dot{H}^s} = \|(|\xi|^s \hat{u})\check{\,}\|_{L^2} < \infty \right\}.

Note: \dot{H}^1 \hookrightarrow L^6 by Sobolev embedding.

Definition A.3.2 (Leray-Hopf Weak Solution).
A vector field u \in L^\infty([0,T]; L^2_\sigma) \cap L^2([0,T]; \dot{H}^1_\sigma) is a Leray-Hopf weak solution if:

1. \partial_t u \in L^1_{\text{loc}}((0,T); \dot{H}^{-1})
2. For all \phi \in C^\infty_c([0,T) \times \mathbb{R}^3; \mathbb{R}^3) with \nabla \cdot \phi = 0:
   \int_0^T \langle u, \partial_t \phi \rangle dt + \int_0^T \langle u \otimes u, \nabla \phi \rangle dt = \langle u_0, \phi(0) \rangle + \nu \int_0^T \langle \nabla u, \nabla \phi \rangle dt
3. The energy inequality holds: \frac{1}{2}\|u(t)\|_{L^2}^2 + \nu \int_0^t \|\nabla u(s)\|_{L^2}^2 ds \le \frac{1}{2}\|u_0\|_{L^2}^2 for a.e. t \in [0,T].

Appendix B: Paradifferential Calculus

This appendix summarizes Bony's paradifferential calculus, used extensively in Part II for analyzing nonlinear interactions.

B.1. Bony Decomposition

Definition B.1.1 (Paraproduct and Remainder).
For two tempered distributions u, v, define:

· Low-high paraproduct: T_u v = \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} S_{j-1} u \, \Delta_j v
· High-low paraproduct: T_v u = \sum_{j \in \mathbb{Z}} S_{j-1} v \, \Delta_j u
· Remainder: R(u,v) = \sum_{|j-k| \le 1} \Delta_j u \, \Delta_k v

The product decomposes as: uv = T_u v + T_v u + R(u,v).

Theorem B.1.2 (Paraproduct Estimates).
Let s \in \mathbb{R}, 1 \le p, p_1, p_2, q \le \infty with \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}.

1. If s > 0: \|T_u v\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p,q}} \lesssim \|u\|_{L^{p_1}} \|v\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p_2,q}}
2. If s < 0: \|T_u v\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p,q}} \lesssim \|u\|_{\dot{B}^{-s}_{p_1,\infty}} \|v\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p_2,q}}
3. For the remainder: if s_1 + s_2 > 0, then
   \|R(u,v)\|_{\dot{B}^{s_1+s_2}_{p,q}} \lesssim \|u\|_{\dot{B}^{s_1}_{p_1,q}} \|v\|_{\dot{B}^{s_2}_{p_2,q}}

B.2. Application to Navier-Stokes

For the Navier-Stokes nonlinearity, we have:

u \cdot \nabla u = \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \partial_i u = T_u \cdot \nabla u + T_{\nabla u} \cdot u + R(u, \nabla u).

Lemma B.2.1.
The transport term satisfies:

\|T_{\nabla u} u\|_{\dot{B}^{-\frac{1}{2}}_{2,\infty}} \lesssim \|u\|_{\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}} \|\nabla u\|_{L^2}.

Lemma B.2.2 (Resonant Term).
The remainder term has improved regularity:

\|R(u, \nabla u)\|_{\dot{B}^{0}_{1,2}} \lesssim \|u\|_{\dot{H}^1}^2.

B.3. Commutator Estimates

Proposition B.3.1.
Let [\Delta_j, u\cdot\nabla]v = \Delta_j(u\cdot\nabla v) - u\cdot\nabla(\Delta_j v). Then for 1 < p < \infty:

\|[\Delta_j, u\cdot\nabla]v\|_{L^p} \lesssim \|\nabla u\|_{L^\infty} \|\Delta_j v\|_{L^p} + 2^j \|\Delta_{\sim j} u\|_{L^\infty} \|v\|_{L^p}.

Appendix C: Weighted Estimates and Maximum Principles

This appendix collects the weighted Hardy-type inequalities and maximum principles used in the analysis of axisymmetric flows in Part III.

C.1. Weighted Hardy Inequalities

Theorem C.1.1 (Hardy Inequality in \mathbb{R}^3).
For u \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3) and \alpha > -3/2:

\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{|u(x)|^2}{|x|^{2\alpha}} dx \le C_\alpha \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u(x)|^2 |x|^{2(1-\alpha)} dx.

Corollary C.1.2 (Axisymmetric Weighted Estimate).
For axisymmetric functions f(r,z) with f(0,z) = 0:

\int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{|f(r,z)|^2}{r^2} \, r\, dr\, dz \le 4 \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\partial_r f(r,z)|^2 \, r\, dr\, dz.

C.2. Maximum Principles for Parabolic Equations

Theorem C.2.1 (Classical Maximum Principle).
Let u \in C^{1,2}((0,T) \times \Omega) \cap C([0,T] \times \bar{\Omega}) satisfy

\partial_t u - \Delta u + b \cdot \nabla u + c u \le 0

with b, c bounded and c \ge 0. Then:

\sup_{[0,T] \times \bar{\Omega}} u \le \sup_{\Gamma} u^+,

where \Gamma = (\{0\} \times \bar{\Omega}) \cup ([0,T] \times \partial\Omega) and u^+ = \max(u, 0).

Theorem C.2.2 (Maximum Principle for Weighted Vorticity).
Let \Gamma = \omega^\phi / r satisfy equation (Γ) from Chapter 9:

(\partial_t + u \cdot \nabla - \nu \Delta) \Gamma = -\frac{2\nu}{r} \partial_r \Gamma.

Then for axisymmetric flows without swirl:

\|\Gamma(t)\|_{L^\infty} \le \|\Gamma(0)\|_{L^\infty} \quad \text{for all } t \ge 0.

Proof sketch. Multiply the equation by \Gamma^{2k-1} for large k, integrate, and use the identity:

\int \frac{2\nu}{r} \partial_r \Gamma \cdot \Gamma^{2k-1} r\, dr\, dz = \frac{\nu}{k} \int \partial_r (\Gamma^{2k}) dr\, dz = 0

after integration by parts (assuming decay at boundaries). Let k \to \infty.

C.3. Cylindrical Coordinates and Vector Calculus

In cylindrical coordinates (r,\phi,z):

· Gradient: \nabla f = \partial_r f \, e_r + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi f \, e_\phi + \partial_z f \, e_z
· Divergence: \nabla \cdot u = \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r u^r) + \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi u^\phi + \partial_z u^z
· Curl: \nabla \times u = \left( \frac{1}{r} \partial_\phi u^z - \partial_z u^\phi \right) e_r + \left( \partial_z u^r - \partial_r u^z \right) e_\phi + \frac{1}{r} \left( \partial_r (r u^\phi) - \partial_\phi u^r \right) e_z
· Laplacian: \Delta f = \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \partial_r f) + \frac{1}{r^2} \partial_\phi^2 f + \partial_z^2 f

For axisymmetric fields (\partial_\phi = 0):

\omega^\phi = \partial_z u^r - \partial_r u^z, \quad \Gamma = \frac{\omega^\phi}{r}.

C.4. Biot-Savart Law in Axisymmetric Form

For axisymmetric velocity u with swirl:

u^r = -\partial_z (\Delta^{-1} \omega^\phi), \quad u^z = \frac{1}{r} \partial_r (r \Delta^{-1} \omega^\phi),

where \Delta^{-1} is the inverse Laplacian with appropriate boundary conditions.

Lemma C.4.1.
There exists C > 0 such that for axisymmetric u without swirl:

|u(t,x)| \le C \|\Gamma(t)\|_{L^\infty} |x| \quad \text{for } |x| \text{ small}.

Appendix D: Frequently Used Inequalities

D.1. Integral Inequalities

Gronwall's Inequality (Differential Form):
If y'(t) \le a(t) y(t) + b(t) for t \ge t_0, then

y(t) \le y(t_0) \exp\left( \int_{t_0}^t a(s) ds \right) + \int_{t_0}^t b(s) \exp\left( \int_s^t a(\tau) d\tau \right) ds.

Gronwall's Inequality (Integral Form):
If y(t) \le a + \int_0^t (b y(s) + c) ds, then y(t) \le a e^{bt} + \frac{c}{b}(e^{bt} - 1).

D.2. Product and Convolution Estimates

Young's Inequality for Convolution:
For 1 \le p, q, r \le \infty with 1 + \frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}:

\|f * g\|_{L^r} \le \|f\|_{L^p} \|g\|_{L^q}.

Holder's Inequality in Besov Spaces:
For s > 0, 1 \le p, p_1, p_2, q \le \infty with \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}:

\|uv\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p,q}} \lesssim \|u\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p_1,q}} \|v\|_{L^{p_2}} + \|u\|_{L^{p_1}} \|v\|_{\dot{B}^s_{p_2,q}}.
