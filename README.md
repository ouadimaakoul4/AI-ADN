Whoever you are — student in a dorm, researcher at 2am, founder sketching Mars plans — thank you.  
This work exists for you. Keep building.  
If my code helped even 1%, drop a ☺️ or tell me what you're making. No pressure, just joy 😌  

This repo is for all humans — no gate, no paywall.  
If you're a student using it for a thesis, a researcher testing topology, a startup scoring resilience → tell us (anonymously if you want).  
Your story inspires more bridges.
