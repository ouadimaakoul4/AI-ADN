Title:
Acoustic Manipulation of Ice Particles in Fluidized Granular Media under Cryogenic Vacuum: A Multi-Scale Stochastic Framework for Lunar Water Extraction



Abstract

Lunar permanently shadowed regions contain water ice essential for sustainable exploration. Existing extraction methods are energy‑intensive or mechanically complex. This PhD develops the first predictive multi‑scale stochastic model for acoustically driven ice‑regolith separation in vacuum, cryogenic granular media. The work integrates:

· Model A – Asymptotic Homogenization of Icy Granular Media: Two‑scale expansion yielding effective stiffness tensors from Hertz–Mindlin–JKR contact laws with ice‑sintered bonds, providing first‑principles wave speed v_p(\omega) and attenuation \alpha(\omega).
· Model B – Stochastic Fluidization Threshold: Langevin dynamics describing the transition from jammed to fluidized states, with first‑passage time criteria for bond breakage and acoustic granular temperature reducing effective friction.
· Model C – Granular Acoustic Radiation Force via Fokker‑Planck: Ice particle trajectory modeled as a biased random walk. The Fokker‑Planck equation yields the probability density function of ice position, enabling prediction of separation purity rather than mere drift velocity. The force law incorporates a correction factor \beta(\phi, \text{St}, \ldots) derived from Physics‑Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) constrained by variational principles and validated against 4D X‑ray micro‑tomography.

The outcome is a validated, open‑source design tool for lunar water extraction systems, replacing empirical trial‑and‑error with predictive physics grounded in continuum mechanics, statistical physics, and topological data analysis.

1. Introduction and Motivation

Humanity's return to the Moon requires in situ resource utilisation. Water ice in permanently shadowed regions is the most valuable resource—for life support, fuel, and radiation shielding. Current extraction concepts (thermal mining, microwave extraction, mechanical excavation) suffer from high energy consumption, moving parts, or contamination.

Acoustic separation offers a solid‑state alternative with no moving parts. However, acoustic manipulation is well‑established only for particles in fluids. No theory exists for dense granular media under vacuum—the actual lunar condition. This PhD addresses that fundamental gap through rigorous mathematical modeling.

3. Theoretical Framework

3.1 Model A: Asymptotic Homogenization of Icy Granular Media

We treat the granular bed as a two‑scale system. Let \mathbf{x} be the macroscopic coordinate and \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}/\epsilon the microscopic coordinate (grain contact scale). The displacement field \mathbf{u} is expanded as:

\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t) = \mathbf{u}_0(\mathbf{x}, t) + \epsilon \mathbf{u}_1(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t) + \epsilon^2 \mathbf{u}_2(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t) + \cdots

At the \mathbf{y}-scale, each grain contact follows Hertz–Mindlin–JKR law with ice‑sintered bonds. The Bonded Particle Model gives contact forces:

\mathbf{F}_n = k_n \mathbf{u}_n + \gamma_n \dot{\mathbf{u}}_n, \quad
\mathbf{F}_t = k_t \mathbf{u}_t + \gamma_t \dot{\mathbf{u}}_t

with failure criteria for ice bonds. Homogenization over a representative volume element yields the effective stiffness tensor:

C_{ijkl}^{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\text{contacts}} k_n \, n_i n_j n_k n_l + k_t \, (t_i n_j t_k n_l + \cdots)

The macroscopic wave equation becomes:

\rho_b \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}_0}{\partial t^2} = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{C}^{\text{eff}} : \nabla \mathbf{u}_0) + \mathbf{F}_{\text{rad}}

This provides first‑principles predictions of wave speed v_p(\omega) and attenuation \alpha(\omega) as functions of ice content, confining pressure, and temperature—without empirical fitting parameters.

Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are used to verify consistency with composite theory, ensuring the homogenized moduli respect thermodynamic limits.

3.2 Model B: Stochastic Fluidization with Granular Temperature

Fluidization in vacuum is not a binary transition but a statistical process. The motion of a representative grain is described by a Langevin equation:

m \frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{F}_{\text{contact}} + \mathbf{F}_{\text{vibration}} - \gamma \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} + \boldsymbol{\xi}(t)

where \boldsymbol{\xi}(t) is Gaussian white noise with autocorrelation \langle \xi_i(t) \xi_j(t') \rangle = 2 \gamma k_B T_{gr} \delta_{ij} \delta(t-t'). Here T_{gr} is the granular temperature—the kinetic energy density of fluctuating grain motions.

The acoustic granular temperature is related to acoustic intensity I and relaxation time \tau:

T_{gr} = \frac{\alpha I}{\rho_b \omega} \tau

Fluidization occurs when a grain escapes its "cage" of neighbors. The first‑passage time \tau_{\text{escape}} satisfies:

\langle \tau_{\text{escape}} \rangle = \int_0^{\infty} \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta U}{k_B T_{gr}} \right) dt

where \Delta U is the potential barrier from adhesion and confinement. Fluidization is achieved when \langle \tau_{\text{escape}} \rangle < 1/f_{\text{vibration}}.

This probabilistic criterion replaces deterministic acceleration thresholds and explains why fluidization onset is gradual.

3.3 Model C: Granular Acoustic Radiation Force and Fokker‑Planck Dynamics

Classical acoustic radiation force (Gor'kov, 1962) assumes a particle in an ideal fluid. For dense granular media, we generalize to a biased random walk described by the Fokker‑Planck equation for the probability density W(\mathbf{x}, t) of finding an ice particle at position \mathbf{x}:

\frac{\partial W}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\mathbf{F}_{\text{rad}}^{\text{granular}}}{\gamma} W \right) + \nabla \cdot \left( D \nabla W \right)

where:

· \mathbf{F}_{\text{rad}}^{\text{granular}} is the deterministic acoustic force
· \gamma is the effective granular drag coefficient
· D = k_B T_{gr} / \gamma is the granular diffusion coefficient

The deterministic force takes the form:

\mathbf{F}_{\text{rad}}^{\text{granular}} = V_p \, \nabla \langle E \rangle \, \beta(\phi, \text{St}, \ldots)

where \langle E \rangle is time‑averaged acoustic energy density and \beta is a correction factor accounting for dense packing, force chains, and impedance mismatch.

3.3.1 Variational Physics‑Informed Neural Networks

To determine \beta across the multi‑dimensional parameter space, we employ Physics‑Informed Neural Networks trained on high‑fidelity DEM simulations (LIGGGHTS). The network minimizes a loss function incorporating:

1. Data fidelity: MSE between predicted and DEM‑measured drift velocities
2. Momentum conservation: Residual of macroscopic momentum balance
3. Energy dissipation: Consistency with Model A attenuation predictions
4. Hamilton's principle: The trajectory minimizes the action S = \int (T - V) dt, where T is kinetic energy and V the effective potential from acoustic field and contact forces

The variational constraint ensures thermodynamic consistency: predicted trajectories respect the least‑action principle of the granular system.

3.3.2 Topological Analysis of Force Chains

Force chains—networks of high‑stress contacts—are analyzed using persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis. The acoustic field's effect on force chain topology is quantified via:

· Betti numbers \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2: Counts of connected components, loops, and cavities in the force network
· Persistence diagrams: Characterizing the birth and death of topological features as acoustic amplitude increases

This reveals how acoustic energy "breaks" force chains to enable fluidization and ice migration, providing a novel link between topology and transport.

Stress Test Answers

Q: "Why does sound speed increase with confining pressure?"

A: "Hertzian contact theory gives k_n \propto F_n^{1/3}. Higher pressure increases contact area and stiffness. Through homogenization, C^{\text{eff}} \propto Z k_n, so wave speed v_p = \sqrt{C^{\text{eff}}/\rho_b} increases as P^{1/6}."

Q: "How does vacuum change acoustic radiation force compared to air?"

A: "In air, force comes from fluid‑structure interaction—scattering of pressure waves in the pore fluid. In vacuum, the pore fluid is absent. Momentum transfers purely through grain contacts. The medium itself becomes the 'fluid,' requiring a new theory where the effective properties come from contact mechanics, not fluid compressibility."

Q: "What's the physical meaning of granular temperature?"

A: "It's the kinetic energy density of fluctuating grain motions—analogous to thermal temperature in molecular gases. In vibrating beds, acoustic energy pumps energy into these fluctuations, reducing effective friction and enabling fluidization. We measure it via high‑speed tracking of grain velocity fluctuations."

Q: "How do you validate a stochastic model?"

A: "We don't validate single trajectories—we validate the distribution. 4D tomography gives us the experimental probability density W_{\text{exp}}(\mathbf{x}, t). We compare to the Fokker‑Planck solution W_{\text{theory}}(\mathbf{x}, t) using Kolmogorov‑Smirnov statistics. If the distributions match, the stochastic dynamics are correct."
