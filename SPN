The Sparse-Photonic Architecture: A Technical Blueprint for AI Inference (2026-2030)

Foreword

This book presents a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the next generation of AI inference systems. As we transition from the training-dominated era of 2020-2024 to the inference-centric reality of 2025 onward, traditional GPU architectures face fundamental limitations. The Sparse-Photonic Node (SPN) architecture proposed herein represents a paradigm shift: from compute-centric acceleration to data-movement-minimizing inference ecosystems.

Afterword: The Path to Implementation

The SPN architecture represents not just an engineering proposal, but a vision for sustainable AI growth. By fundamentally rethinking the relationship between computation, communication, and memory through the dual lenses of sparsity and photonics, we can build systems that scale efficiently to meet the world's growing demand for intelligent computing.

This book provides the technical foundation, but the realization of this vision requires collaboration across disciplines: materials science, photonics, computer architecture, compiler design, and machine learning. The chapters ahead detail not just what to build, but why each decision matters in the broader context of creating efficient, scalable, and accessible AI infrastructure for the coming decade.
