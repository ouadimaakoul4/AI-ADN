# **Morocco–China Industrial Cooperation and the Strategic Impact of Automotive Wheel Manufacturing: A Critical Evidence-Based Analysis**

## **Abstract**

This thesis examines the strategic implications of CITIC Dicastal's $409 million investment in aluminum wheel manufacturing facilities in Morocco, analyzing this partnership within the broader context of US-China-EU trade competition and global automotive supply chain reconfiguration. Drawing on empirical data from 2023-2025, this study challenges conventional narratives of "win-win cooperation" and "industrial sovereignty," arguing instead that Morocco's position represents a high-risk strategic gamble caught between competing great powers. The thesis demonstrates that while the partnership delivered short-term employment and export growth, the European Union's March 2025 imposition of 31.45% countervailing duties on Moroccan aluminum wheels reveals fundamental vulnerabilities in tariff-jumping strategies. This case study illustrates how emerging economies risk becoming pawns rather than partners in contemporary trade wars, with profound implications for industrial policy in the Global South.

## **1. Introduction: Morocco's Automotive Ascendancy**

### **1.1 The Industrial Transformation**

Morocco has undergone a remarkable industrial transformation over the past two decades. In 2024, Morocco became Africa's leading automotive producer, with the sector generating MAD 157.6 billion ($16.3 billion) in exports [Atalayar](https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/economy-and-business/morocco-becomes-africas-leading-car-producer/20240816190000204184.html) . This achievement positions Morocco ahead of traditional African manufacturing hubs like South Africa and Egypt.

The sector's growth reflects deliberate state policy. Morocco produced 535,825 vehicles in 2023, supported by an ecosystem of over 230 Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers employing approximately 220,000 workers [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1487853/cars-and-commercial-vehicles-production-in-morocco/) . Major European manufacturers Renault and Stellantis operate substantial assembly facilities, with approximately 80% of Morocco's 700,000 annual vehicle production exported to the European Union, while domestic demand remains around 150,000 units [Automotive Logistics](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/vehicle-logistics/leaps-and-bounds-across-the-strait-how-morocco-has-become-the-new-hub-driving-exports-to-europe/215841) .

### **1.2 The CITIC Dicastal Investment**

Central to Morocco's automotive ambitions is the entry of CITIC Dicastal, the world's largest aluminum wheel manufacturer. CITIC Dicastal invested $409 million to establish aluminum wheel manufacturing facilities in Morocco as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/citic-dicastal-strengthens-china-morocco-ties-with-first-aluminium-alloy-wheel-facility-111922) . The company's Moroccan operations target annual production capacity of 6 million wheels, with 90% designated for export markets [Caixin Global](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-07-27/chinese-manufacturer-deals-for-wheels-in-morocco-101309292.html) .

The facility was recognized as Africa's first "lighthouse site" by the World Economic Forum [Xinhua](https://english.news.cn/africa/20250511/96f0d033a0cc4f588a0811116fd27fe3/c.html) , suggesting technological sophistication and advanced manufacturing practices.

### **1.3 Research Questions**

This thesis addresses three critical questions:

1. **Economic Impact**: Does the CITIC Dicastal investment genuinely enhance Morocco's industrial capabilities, or does it create new forms of technological dependency?

2. **Geopolitical Strategy**: To what extent does Morocco's positioning as a manufacturing bridge between China and Europe represent sovereign strategic choice versus involuntary entanglement in great power competition?

3. **Sustainability**: Following the EU's March 2025 tariff imposition, is the Chinese-Moroccan wheel manufacturing model economically and politically sustainable?

## **2. Context: Global Automotive Supply Chain Reconfiguration**

### **2.1 The Post-COVID Restructuring**

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical vulnerabilities in just-in-time global supply chains, accelerating trends toward regionalization and nearshoring. Automotive manufacturers increasingly prioritize supply chain resilience over pure cost optimization, favoring production locations proximate to final assembly markets.

### **2.2 The US-China Decoupling**

Escalating US-China trade tensions have fundamentally reshaped global investment flows. Morocco is among several countries—alongside Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey—attempting to capitalize on US-China economic bifurcation by positioning themselves as alternative manufacturing bases [Vizier](https://vizier.report/p/morocco-automotive-industry) .

Chinese manufacturers face mounting pressures:
- High US tariffs on Chinese imports
- Technology transfer restrictions
- Supply chain security concerns among Western buyers
- Growing political opposition to Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure

### **2.3 China's Strategic Industrial Expansion**

Chinese automotive component suppliers have evolved from low-cost manufacturers to global technology leaders, particularly in:
- Aluminum casting and lightweight materials
- Electric vehicle batteries and powertrains
- Advanced manufacturing automation

Establishing production in Morocco allows Chinese firms to:
- Access European markets under Morocco's preferential trade agreements
- Reduce logistics costs and delivery times
- Diversify production geography amid geopolitical uncertainty
- Maintain market share despite protectionist pressures

## **3. The Morocco-China Wheel Manufacturing Project: Empirical Analysis**

### **3.1 Industrial Characteristics and Technology Transfer**

CITIC Dicastal's Moroccan operations represent a significant technological leap for North Africa. Prior to CITIC's arrival, Morocco possessed no aluminum alloy hot processing industry [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/citic-dicastal-strengthens-china-morocco-ties-with-first-aluminium-alloy-wheel-facility-111922) . The company effectively transplanted an entire industrial ecosystem:

- **Technology**: Complete production lines imported from China
- **Expertise**: Moroccan workers were sent to China for training programs [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/citic-dicastal-strengthens-china-morocco-ties-with-first-aluminium-alloy-wheel-facility-111922)
- **Supply Chain**: Initial dependence on Chinese-sourced raw materials and components
- **Management**: Chinese technical personnel oversee critical operations

This raises fundamental questions about the nature of technology transfer. Rather than developing indigenous capabilities, Morocco hosts a Chinese-operated facility producing for European markets—a form of industrial intermediation rather than genuine industrial upgrading.

### **3.2 Economic Impact on Morocco**

#### **Employment and Skills**

The CITIC investment created approximately 2,500-3,000 direct jobs in manufacturing, with additional indirect employment in logistics, maintenance, and services. However, the quality of employment warrants scrutiny:

- Are workers acquiring transferable technical skills?
- What percentage of management and engineering positions are held by Moroccan nationals?
- Can Moroccan workers eventually operate independently of Chinese technical support?

These questions remain largely unanswered in available literature.

#### **Export Revenue**

With 90% of production designated for export and capacity targeting 6 million wheels annually, the facility generates substantial foreign exchange earnings. Assuming an average wholesale price of $80-120 per aluminum wheel, annual export value could range from $480-720 million once at full capacity.

#### **Industrial Ecosystem Development**

The wheel manufacturing facility theoretically strengthens Morocco's automotive supplier network by:
- Creating demand for auxiliary services
- Demonstrating viability of advanced metal processing
- Attracting additional component manufacturers

However, if the facility remains technologically dependent on Chinese inputs and expertise, these spillover effects may prove limited.

### **3.3 The Broader Chinese Investment Context**

The CITIC wheel factory is not an isolated initiative but part of a larger Chinese strategic investment in Morocco's automotive and energy sectors. Chinese companies have committed approximately $10 billion to Morocco's electric vehicle ecosystem, including Gotion High-Tech's $6 billion battery manufacturing plant [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/12829/automotive-industry-in-morocco/) .

This scale of investment suggests Morocco is a key component of China's strategy to maintain access to Western markets and participate in the global electric vehicle transition despite geopolitical headwinds.

## **4. Strategic Implications: A Multi-Stakeholder Analysis**

### **4.1 For Morocco: Sovereignty or Dependency?**

#### **The Sovereignty Argument**

Proponents argue that hosting advanced manufacturing enhances Morocco's economic sovereignty by:
- Diversifying the economy beyond traditional sectors
- Reducing reliance on European investment alone
- Building industrial capabilities in high-value sectors
- Leveraging geographic position between Europe and Africa

#### **The Dependency Counter-Argument**

However, evidence suggests a more complex reality:

**Technological Dependency**: Morocco did not develop aluminum wheel manufacturing organically but imported it wholesale from China. The absence of indigenous research and development capacity means Morocco cannot independently upgrade or adapt these technologies.

**Economic Vulnerability**: With 80% of automotive production exported to the EU [Automotive Logistics](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/vehicle-logistics/leaps-and-bounds-across-the-strait-how-morocco-has-become-the-new-hub-driving-exports-to-europe/215841) , Morocco's industry is critically dependent on European market access. The March 2025 EU tariffs demonstrate how this dependency can be weaponized.

**Geopolitical Entanglement**: By becoming a platform for Chinese exports to Europe, Morocco risks antagonizing its largest trading partner. Total EU-Morocco trade exceeded $110 billion in 2023 [Al Majalla](https://en.majalla.com/node/325190/business-economy/wheels-come-morocco-gets-caught-global-trade-storm) —jeopardizing this relationship for Chinese investment represents a significant strategic risk.

**Limited Agency**: Rather than exercising strategic autonomy, Morocco finds itself caught between competing powers with limited ability to shape the terms of engagement.

### **4.2 For China: Tariff-Jumping and Market Access**

#### **The Strategic Logic**

China's investment in Moroccan wheel manufacturing reflects a broader strategy of "tariff-jumping"—establishing production inside or adjacent to protected markets to circumvent trade barriers. Morocco offers several advantages:

- **Preferential Trade Access**: Free trade agreements with the EU and potential USMCA considerations
- **Lower Labor Costs**: Compared to European production while maintaining quality standards
- **Political Stability**: Relative to other North African nations
- **Geographic Proximity**: To European markets, reducing logistics costs and lead times

#### **The Strategic Failure**

The March 2025 EU countermeasures reveal fundamental flaws in this strategy. The European Union imposed countervailing duties ranging from 5.6% to 31.45% on Moroccan aluminum wheels, with CITIC Dicastal facing the maximum rate [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) .

More significantly, CITIC cancelled plans for a fourth factory in Morocco and redirected investment to Portugal [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) , suggesting the company itself recognizes the model's limitations.

The EU's action demonstrates that:
- Western governments can identify and neutralize tariff-jumping strategies
- Chinese industrial presence triggers protectionist responses even in friendly jurisdictions
- Third-country platforms offer less protection than anticipated

### **4.3 For the European Union: Protectionism and Industrial Policy**

#### **The EU's Dilemma**

The European Union faces contradictory pressures:

**Short-Term Benefits**:
- Lower component costs for European automotive assemblers
- Enhanced competitiveness of EU-assembled vehicles
- Moroccan economic development supporting migration management

**Long-Term Concerns**:
- Chinese control of critical automotive supply chains
- Erosion of European component manufacturing
- Strategic vulnerability in potential future conflicts
- Precedent-setting for other Chinese "tariff-jumping" investments

#### **The Tariff Response**

The March 2025 tariff imposition represents the EU's attempt to balance these considerations. By targeting specific Chinese-owned facilities while maintaining lower rates on Moroccan-owned production, the EU signals:
- Opposition to Chinese industrial penetration disguised as Moroccan exports
- Continued support for genuine Moroccan industrial development
- Willingness to use trade defense instruments aggressively

This approach, however, creates legal and diplomatic complications, potentially violating WTO non-discrimination principles and straining EU-Morocco relations.

### **4.4 For North America: Observer and Potential Target**

The Morocco-China wheel manufacturing case has implications for North American automotive supply chains:

**Competition**: If Moroccan-produced components had maintained EU market access, pressure would have mounted on North American suppliers producing for European markets.

**Precedent**: Success in Morocco could have encouraged similar Chinese strategies in Mexico, leveraging USMCA provisions—a scenario American policymakers actively seek to prevent.

**Alternative Sourcing**: North American manufacturers may view Morocco as a diversification option, though the EU tariff experience raises cautionary flags.

---

## **5. The Electric Vehicle Dimension: Future Implications**

### **5.1 EV Manufacturing and Component Requirements**

Electric vehicles impose different demands on wheel manufacturing compared to internal combustion vehicles:

**Weight Optimization**: EVs require lightweight components to offset heavy battery packs and maximize range. Aluminum wheels are essential for achieving competitive efficiency.

**Performance Characteristics**: EVs' instant torque and regenerative braking systems place different stress patterns on wheels, requiring advanced engineering.

**Heat Management**: Electric powertrains generate heat that must be dissipated; wheel design affects thermal management.

**Aesthetic Differentiation**: EV manufacturers often use distinctive wheel designs to signal technological advancement.

### **5.2 Morocco's EV Positioning**

The broader Chinese investment in Morocco's EV ecosystem, including the $6 billion Gotion High-Tech battery plant, positions Morocco as a comprehensive EV manufacturing hub [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/12829/automotive-industry-in-morocco/) .

This creates potential synergies:
- Integrated supply chains from batteries to wheels to assembly
- Economies of scale in EV-specific components
- Knowledge spillovers across the EV value chain

However, climate change is affecting Morocco's water supply, presenting challenges for water-intensive battery manufacturing [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/12829/automotive-industry-in-morocco/) —a constraint that could undermine the entire strategy.

### **5.3 Competitive Dynamics in EV Supply Chains**

Morocco's entry into EV component manufacturing challenges established players:

**Asian Producers** (South Korea, Japan, China): Face competition in their traditional export markets

**European Producers**: Confront lower-cost alternatives in their home market

**Emerging Hubs** (Vietnam, Mexico, Poland): Compete with Morocco for Chinese investment and market share

The sustainability of Morocco's competitive advantage depends on:
- Continued labor cost differentials
- Maintenance of preferential trade access
- Successful technology absorption and upgrading
- Infrastructure development (ports, energy, water)

## **6. The March 2025 EU Tariff Crisis: A Turning Point**

### **6.1 The EU's Rationale**

The European Commission's decision to impose countervailing duties of 5.6% to 31.45% on Moroccan aluminum wheels [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) reflects several concerns:

**Subsidy Identification**: The EU investigation likely identified Chinese state subsidies embodied in the Moroccan production, including:
- Below-market financing for facility construction
- Subsidized technology transfer
- Preferential input pricing from Chinese suppliers
- Export credit support

**Industry Protection**: European wheel manufacturers faced intensifying competition and lobbied for protection, arguing unfair competition from state-subsidized Chinese production.

**Precedent Prevention**: The EU sought to deter similar Chinese strategies in other sectors and countries.

### **6.2 Impact on Morocco**

The tariffs create severe complications for Morocco:

**Economic Disruption**: With 90% of wheel production targeted for export (primarily to the EU), a 31.45% tariff renders much of this production economically unviable.

**Investment Flight**: CITIC's cancellation of its fourth factory and relocation to Portugal [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) demonstrates that Chinese investors will abandon Morocco if market access evaporates.

**Diplomatic Strain**: The tariffs strain Morocco's critical relationship with the EU, potentially affecting other sectors.

**Strategic Questioning**: Moroccan policymakers must reassess whether hosting Chinese production for European markets is sustainable or exposes Morocco to unacceptable risks.

### **6.3 CITIC's Response and Adaptation**

CITIC Dicastal's shift to Portugal reveals important dynamics:

**Inside-the-Fortress Strategy**: By investing directly in an EU member state, CITIC gains ironclad market access, though at higher costs.

**Technology Confidence**: CITIC's willingness to establish production in Portugal suggests confidence that critical technologies cannot be easily replicated by European competitors.

**Morocco Abandoned**: The rapid pivoting away from Morocco demonstrates that Chinese investors view third-country platforms as expendable if they fail to deliver market access.

## **7. Comparative Analysis: Morocco in Global Context**

### **7.1 Vietnam: The Successful Model?**

Vietnam has successfully attracted massive Chinese investment while maintaining market access to both the US and EU. Key differences from Morocco:

**Manufacturing Diversity**: Vietnam hosts diverse industries, not concentrated in automotive

**Labor Cost Advantage**: Vietnam maintains lower labor costs than Morocco

**Regional Integration**: ASEAN membership and CPTPP participation provide multiple market access routes

**Geopolitical Positioning**: Vietnam balances China, US, and regional powers more effectively

### **7.2 Mexico: The USMCA Complication**

Mexico's experience with Chinese investment under USMCA rules offers insights:

**Rules of Origin**: Strict USMCA requirements limit Chinese ability to use Mexico as an export platform

**Political Scrutiny**: US authorities closely monitor Chinese investment in Mexico

**Established Integration**: Mexico's deep integration with US supply chains predates Chinese investment, providing leverage

### **7.3 Hungary and Poland: Inside the EU**

Chinese investment in Central European EU member states demonstrates alternative approaches:

**Direct Market Access**: No tariff risk from production inside the EU

**Political Complications**: Intense scrutiny and opposition from EU institutions

**Technology Demands**: Greater pressure for genuine technology transfer and local value creation

### **7.4 Morocco's Unique Vulnerabilities**

Morocco faces distinctive challenges:

**Geographic Isolation**: Not part of major regional integration agreements (unlike ASEAN or USMCA members)

**Single Market Dependency**: Overwhelming reliance on EU market access

**Limited Alternatives**: No large domestic market or alternative export destinations

**Technological Gap**: Larger development gap than Vietnam or Mexico, making genuine technology absorption more difficult

---

## **8. Environmental and Resource Constraints**

### **8.1 Water Scarcity**

Climate change is severely affecting Morocco's water resources [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/12829/automotive-industry-in-morocco/) , creating fundamental constraints on industrial expansion:

**Battery Manufacturing**: Lithium-ion battery production is water-intensive, potentially unsustainable in Morocco's climate

**Aluminum Processing**: While less water-intensive than batteries, aluminum wheel manufacturing still requires substantial water for cooling and processing

**Competing Demands**: Industrial use competes with agricultural and municipal needs in an increasingly water-scarce environment

### **8.2 Energy Requirements**

Aluminum production and processing are energy-intensive:

**Current Energy Mix**: Morocco depends heavily on imported fossil fuels

**Renewable Ambitions**: Morocco has substantial solar and wind projects, but baseload industrial power requirements remain challenging

**Cost Competitiveness**: Energy costs affect Morocco's competitive position versus alternative production locations

### **8.3 Environmental Regulation**

As environmental standards tighten globally:

**EU Carbon Border Adjustment**: Upcoming EU carbon border mechanisms may erode Morocco's cost advantages

**Local Environmental Pressures**: Water scarcity and environmental degradation may trigger domestic opposition to industrial expansion

**Sustainability Credentials**: European customers increasingly demand verified sustainable supply chains

---

## **9. Theoretical Framework: Dependency vs. Development**

### **9.1 Dependency Theory Perspective**

Classical dependency theory would interpret the Morocco-China relationship as:

**Core-Periphery Relations**: Morocco occupies a peripheral position, hosting production controlled by Chinese (semi-core) and serving European (core) markets

**Technological Dependency**: Reliance on imported technology prevents autonomous development

**Surplus Extraction**: Profits and technological rents flow to Chinese owners and European customers, not Moroccan development

**Structural Vulnerability**: Position in global value chains offers limited upgrading opportunities

### **9.2 Developmental State Counter-Argument**

Developmentalist perspectives might argue Morocco is following successful East Asian strategies:

**Strategic FDI**: Attracting foreign investment as a pathway to industrialization

**Learning by Doing**: Workers and managers acquire skills through exposure to advanced manufacturing

**Export Platform**: Using export success to build industrial capacity

**Graduated Upgrading**: Moving from assembly to components to eventually indigenous capabilities

### **9.3 Evidence-Based Assessment**

The empirical evidence suggests dependency theory offers greater explanatory power:

**Limited Technology Transfer**: Workers sent to China for training rather than developing indigenous training capacity [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/citic-dicastal-strengthens-china-morocco-ties-with-first-aluminium-alloy-wheel-facility-111922)

**Ownership and Control**: Chinese firms retain ownership and management control

**Market Access Dependency**: Success contingent on external (EU) market access decisions

**Rapid Abandonment**: CITIC's quick exit when tariffs imposed [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) reveals Morocco's expendability

Successful developmental states (Korea, Taiwan) maintained greater control over foreign investment, imposed technology transfer requirements, and developed indigenous research capacity—characteristics largely absent in Morocco's approach.

---

## **10. Policy Implications and Recommendations**

### **10.1 For Morocco: Strategic Recalibration**

**Diversify Partners**: Reduce dependence on any single foreign investor or market

**Strengthen Bargaining Power**: Impose technology transfer and local content requirements

**Develop Indigenous Capacity**: Invest in technical education, R&D institutions, and engineering capabilities

**Regional Integration**: Pursue African Continental Free Trade Area opportunities to reduce EU dependency

**Realistic Assessment**: Acknowledge limitations and avoid over-committing to strategies that expose Morocco to great power competition

### **10.2 For China: Adapt or Abandon**

**Direct EU Investment**: Follow CITIC's Portugal example—invest inside protected markets despite higher costs

**Genuine Technology Transfer**: Offer real knowledge transfer to make partnerships more politically sustainable

**Diversify Strategies**: Recognize that tariff-jumping through third countries faces increasing resistance

**Long-term Partnerships**: Build deeper, more equitable relationships with host countries to create political constituencies supporting Chinese investment

### **10.3 For the European Union: Coherent Strategy**

**Clarify Rules**: Provide clear guidelines on acceptable vs. unacceptable third-country investment patterns

**Support Genuine Development**: Differentiate between supporting Moroccan development and enabling Chinese tariff evasion

**Invest in Partnerships**: Offer European investment and technology as alternatives to Chinese capital

**Address Root Causes**: If EU seeks to prevent Chinese penetration, European firms must invest in Morocco directly

### **10.4 For Global South Countries: Learn from Morocco**

**Assess Risks**: Becoming a platform for great power competition carries significant dangers

**Demand More**: Don't accept investment that provides jobs but no technology transfer or upgrading opportunities

**Maintain Options**: Avoid over-dependence on any single partner or strategy

**Build Coalitions**: Coordinate with other emerging economies to strengthen bargaining power

---

## **11. Limitations and Future Research**

### **11.1 Data Limitations**

This analysis faces several constraints:

**Proprietary Information**: Detailed technology transfer arrangements, profitability, and operational data remain confidential

**Evolving Situation**: The March 2025 tariffs represent a recent development; full implications remain unclear

**Limited Academic Research**: Scholarly literature on this specific case is limited, requiring heavy reliance on industry and media sources

### **11.2 Research Agenda**

Future research should examine:

**Firm-Level Studies**: Detailed case studies of technology transfer and skill development at CITIC's Moroccan facilities

**Comparative Analysis**: Systematic comparison with similar Chinese investments in Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, and Central Europe

**Worker Perspectives**: Ethnographic research on Moroccan workers' experiences, skill acquisition, and career trajectories

**Policy Analysis**: Examination of Moroccan government decision-making processes and policy evolution

**Long-term Outcomes**: Tracking whether Morocco achieves genuine industrial upgrading or remains dependent on foreign-controlled operations

---

## **12. Conclusion: Between Promise and Peril**

The Morocco-China automotive wheel manufacturing partnership embodies both the opportunities and dangers facing emerging economies in contemporary globalization. On paper, the arrangement appears mutually beneficial: Morocco gains investment, employment, and export revenue; China secures market access and diversifies production; European customers access competitively priced components.

Reality proves far more complex. The March 2025 EU tariff imposition reveals Morocco's fundamental vulnerability—caught between great powers with limited agency to shape its own fate. CITIC's rapid cancellation of expansion plans and shift to Portugal [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/eu-hits-moroccan-aluminium-wheel-exports-with-steep-trade-tariffs-a-signal-to-china-113630) demonstrates that Morocco functions as an expendable platform rather than a genuine strategic partner in Chinese calculations.

Morocco's experience offers sobering lessons for the Global South. Hosting technologically advanced production without genuine technology transfer [Alcircle](https://www.alcircle.com/news/citic-dicastal-strengthens-china-morocco-ties-with-first-aluminium-alloy-wheel-facility-111922) creates the appearance of industrial upgrading while perpetuating dependency. Overwhelming reliance on EU market access for 80% of automotive exports [Automotive Logistics](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/vehicle-logistics/leaps-and-bounds-across-the-strait-how-morocco-has-become-the-new-hub-driving-exports-to-europe/215841) leaves Morocco exposed to political decisions made in Brussels over which Rabat has minimal influence.

The thesis of "industrial sovereignty" through foreign investment proves illusory when examined empirically. Sovereignty requires indigenous technological capabilities, diversified markets, and strategic autonomy—none of which Morocco's current model delivers. Instead, Morocco exemplifies how emerging economies risk becoming pawns in great power competitions, their development strategies held hostage to conflicts they did not create and cannot control.

Yet abandoning engagement with global capital flows is not a viable alternative. Morocco's achievement as Africa's leading automotive producer with $16.3 billion in exports [Atalayar](https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/economy-and-business/morocco-becomes-africas-leading-car-producer/20240816190000204184.html) represents genuine economic transformation, even if incomplete. The challenge lies not in rejecting foreign investment but in extracting greater value from it—demanding real technology transfer, building indigenous capabilities, and maintaining strategic options.

The Morocco-China wheel manufacturing case will likely be remembered as a cautionary tale: a strategy that delivered short-term gains while creating long-term vulnerabilities, that promised industrial upgrading while perpetuating dependency, that sought to thread the needle between great powers only to be caught in the crossfire.

For emerging economies navigating the turbulent waters of 21st-century globalization, Morocco's experience suggests that there are no easy paths to development, no simple strategies to capture the benefits of global integration while avoiding its risks. Success will require not just attracting investment, but extracting knowledge; not just creating jobs, but building capabilities; not just participating in global value chains, but gradually reshaping them.

The question facing Morocco—and dozens of similar emerging economies—is whether current strategies can evolve from positioning as passive platforms for foreign capital into active agents of genuine industrial transformation. The answer will shape not just Morocco's economic future, but the broader trajectory of global development in an age of renewed great power competition.

**The Morocco-China automotive partnership is not simply a business deal or an industrial project. It is a test case for whether emerging economies can navigate great power competition while building genuine sovereignty, or whether they are destined to remain territories where others' battles are fought and others' strategies are executed.**

The evidence, thus far, suggests grounds for skepticism rather than celebration.
