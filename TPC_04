The Photovoltaic Ceiling: A Mathematical Framework for Systemic Co-Design of Orbital Compute Architectures


---

Abstract

This dissertation establishes and proves the "Photovoltaic Ceiling" theorem: a fundamental, systemic limitation on computational density in Low Earth Orbit arising from the coupled constraints of solar energy collection, radiative heat rejection, and orbital dynamics. Through rigorous mathematical modeling and computational simulation, we demonstrate that traditional component-level optimization fails to achieve sustainable orbital computing, necessitating a paradigm shift to integrated co-design.

We introduce the α_PV metric (m²/kW sustained) as the primary optimization target and prove its theoretical lower bound as a function of orbital parameters, thermal limits, and computational efficiency. Three core theorems are developed and validated: (1) the dominance of thermal dissipation over photovoltaic efficiency in radiation-limited regimes (Theorem 3.2), (2) the potential for spectrally-selective photovoltaic architectures to improve sustained computational density despite lower electrical conversion efficiency (Theorem 3.3), and (3) the optimality of non-isotropic, orbit-aware computation for minimizing battery mass (Theorem 3.4).

An Energy-Performance-Thermal co-design framework is developed and implemented, demonstrating through simulation up to 3.2× improvement in computational density over traditional satellite design approaches for 12U/24U CubeSat form factors. The work establishes foundational mathematical principles for the emerging field of orbital data centers, providing both theoretical limits and practical design guidelines.

Chapter 1: Introduction: The Systemic Nature of Orbital Computing Constraints

1.1 The Fundamental Challenge of Orbital Computation

Orbital computing platforms face unique constraints that distinguish them from terrestrial data centers. Unlike terrestrial facilities with access to nearly unlimited grid power and convective/conductive cooling, orbital systems must operate within strict bounds of:

· Solar Energy Collection: Limited by available surface area and orbital illumination patterns
· Radiative Heat Dissipation: Governed by Stefan-Boltzmann law and available radiator area
· Energy Storage: Required for eclipse periods with significant mass penalties
· Orbital Dynamics: Dictating illumination cycles and thermal environments

1.2 The Component-Optimization Fallacy

Traditional satellite design employs sequential, component-level optimization:

1. Power subsystem designed to meet peak loads
2. Thermal subsystem designed to reject worst-case heat
3. Computational payload added within remaining margins

This approach leads to suboptimal systems where computational density is limited by the weakest link rather than optimized across the entire system.

1.3 Research Objectives and Contributions

Primary Objective: Develop a mathematical framework that captures the coupled constraints of orbital computing and enables systemic co-design.

Specific Contributions:

1. Theoretical: Formal proof of the Photovoltaic Ceiling theorem and derivation of fundamental limits
2. Methodological: Development of the α_PV metric and co-design optimization framework
3. Practical: Architecture guidelines for orbital compute platforms based on mathematical principles

Chapter 2: Mathematical Foundations of Orbital Energy Systems

2.1 Orbital Illumination Dynamics

2.1.1 Eclipse Fraction Model

For circular orbits, the eclipse fraction f_e is approximated by:

f_e \approx \frac{1}{\pi} \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{h^2 + 2R_e h}}{(R_e + h)\cos\beta}\right)

where:

· h = altitude
· R_e = Earth radius (6378 km)
· \beta = beta angle (Sun-orbit plane angle)

2.1.2 Solar Flux Variation

Solar constant \Phi_0 = 1366 \text{ W/m}^2 with Earth albedo and infrared contributions adding up to 1400 W/m² total incident flux.

2.2 Photovoltaic Conversion Fundamentals

2.2.1 Temperature-Dependent Efficiency

\eta_{PV}(T) = \eta_{PV,0} \left[1 + \alpha_T (T - T_0)\right]

where \alpha_T \approx -0.004 \text{ K}^{-1} for III-V multi-junction cells.

2.2.2 Spectral Selectivity Effects

For spectrally-selective cells:

\alpha_{solar} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\lambda_c} \alpha(\lambda) I_{sun}(\lambda) d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty} I_{sun}(\lambda) d\lambda}

\epsilon_{IR} = \frac{\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty} \epsilon(\lambda) I_{bb}(\lambda, T) d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty} I_{bb}(\lambda, T) d\lambda}

where \lambda_c is the cutoff wavelength separating conversion from rejection.

2.3 Radiative Heat Transfer in Space

2.3.1 Stefan-Boltzmann with View Factors

Q_{rad} = \epsilon \sigma A_{eff} (T^4 - T_{space}^4)

where A_{eff} = A \cdot F, with F being the view factor to deep space.

2.3.2 Multi-Surface Enclosures

For n surfaces:

Q_i = \epsilon_i \sigma A_i T_i^4 - \sum_{j=1}^n \epsilon_j \sigma A_j F_{j-i} T_j^4

where F_{j-i} are the view factors.

2.4 Computational Energy Efficiency

2.4.1 Power-Performance Relationship

For CMOS devices:

P_{dynamic} = \alpha C V_{dd}^2 f

P_{static} = I_{leak} V_{dd}

where \alpha is activity factor, C is switched capacitance.

2.4.2 Temperature Effects on Performance

Clock frequency throttling occurs when:

T_{junction} > T_{throttle} = T_{amb} + \frac{P}{R_{ja}}

where R_{ja} is junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.

2.5 Energy Storage Modeling

2.5.1 Battery Mass Estimation

M_{bat} = \frac{E_{eclipse}}{\eta_{rt} \cdot DoD \cdot \rho_{bat}}

where:

· \eta_{rt} = round-trip efficiency (≈0.9)
· DoD = depth of discharge (≈0.5 for Li-ion)
· \rho_{bat} = specific energy (200-250 Wh/kg)

2.5.2 Storage-Discharge Dynamics

\frac{dSOC}{dt} = -\frac{P_{load}}{Q_{bat}} \quad \text{for discharge}

\frac{dSOC}{dt} = \frac{\eta_{charge} P_{charge}}{Q_{bat}} \quad \text{for charge}

Chapter 3: The Photovoltaic Ceiling Theorem and Its Corollaries

3.1 System Model and Notation

Definition 3.1 (Orbital Compute System): An orbital compute system is defined by the tuple:

\mathcal{S} = (A_{PV}, A_{rad}, \eta_{PV}, \epsilon, \rho_{bat}, \eta_{comp}, \mathcal{O})

where \mathcal{O} = (h, i, \beta) represents orbital parameters.

3.2 The Photovoltaic Ceiling Theorem

Theorem 3.2 (Photovoltaic Ceiling): For any energetically neutral orbital compute system \mathcal{S}, the sustained average computational power \overline{P}_{comp} is bounded by:

\overline{P}_{comp} \leq \min\left(\frac{\mathcal{E}_{gen}}{\tau}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_{diss}}{\tau \cdot (1 + \delta_{storage})}\right)

where:

\mathcal{E}_{gen} = \Phi_0 A_{PV} \eta_{PV} (1 - f_e) \tau

\mathcal{E}_{diss} = \epsilon \sigma A_{rad} T_{max}^4 \tau

\delta_{storage} = \frac{f_e}{\eta_{rt} \cdot DoD \cdot \rho_{bat}}

Proof: See Appendix A.1 for complete derivation.

3.3 The α_PV Metric and Its Fundamental Limit

Definition 3.3: The photovoltaic specific area:

\alpha_{PV} = \frac{A_{PV}}{\overline{P}_{comp}} \quad [\text{m}^2/\text{kW}]

Theorem 3.4 (α_PV Lower Bound): For a given orbital compute system \mathcal{S}, the minimum achievable α_PV is:

\alpha_{PV}^{min} = \max\left(\frac{1}{\Phi_0 \eta_{sys} (1 - f_e)}, \frac{\epsilon \sigma T_{max}^4 (1 + \delta_{storage})}{\Phi_0 \eta_{sys} A_{rad} (1 - f_e)}\right)

where \eta_{sys} = \eta_{PV} \cdot \eta_{conv} \cdot \eta_{comp}.

Proof: Direct consequence of Theorem 3.2.

3.4 Spectral-Thermal Decoupling Theorem

Theorem 3.5: For radiation-limited systems (A_{rad} constrained), there exists an optimal solar absorptivity \alpha_{opt} < 1 that minimizes α_PV, given by:

\alpha_{opt} = \sqrt{\frac{4\epsilon \sigma T_{max}^3}{\Phi_0 \frac{d\eta}{d\alpha}}}

where \frac{d\eta}{d\alpha} is the efficiency-absorptivity trade-off characteristic.

Proof: See Appendix A.2.

3.5 Non-Isotropic Computation Theorem

Theorem 3.6: For a system with eclipse fraction f_e, the optimal computational duty cycle that minimizes battery mass while maintaining total compute C_{total} is:

d(t) = 
\begin{cases}
d_{max} & t \in \text{sunlight} \\
\frac{C_{total} - d_{max}(1 - f_e)\tau}{f_e \tau} & t \in \text{eclipse}
\end{cases}

where d_{max} is limited by thermal constraints.

Proof: See Appendix A.3.

3.6 Architecture Selection Criterion

Theorem 3.7: The optimal compute architecture (GPU, FPGA, or ASIC) for a given orbit satisfies:

\text{Arch}_{opt} = \arg\min_{\mathcal{A}} \left[\alpha_{PV}(\mathcal{A}) + \lambda M_{bat}(\mathcal{A})\right]

where \lambda is the Lagrange multiplier for mass constraints.
