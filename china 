The New Engine: China's Ascendancy in Physical AI (2025 White Paper)

Executive Summary

The global technological paradigm is undergoing a fundamental shift from digital intelligence to physical intelligence. In 2025, China has decisively positioned itself not merely as a participant but as the primary engine of this transformation. While Western innovation remains focused on perfecting large language models (LLMs) and abstract artificial general intelligence (AGI), China has executed a strategic, large-scale pivot toward Embodied AI or Physical AI—artificial intelligence that perceives, reasons, and acts directly within the physical world through robots, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent machines.

This white paper synthesizes data from the 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC), industry reports, and market analyses to document China's structural leadership across three interconnected pillars: Robotics, Autonomous Mobility, and an AI Ecosystem optimized for action. This leadership is underpinned by a rapidly indigenizing semiconductor industry and a clear geopolitical strategy of technological autonomy. The evidence suggests we are witnessing a historic inflection point, where China is defining the future of human-machine interaction at an unprecedented industrial scale.

I. The Dawn of a New Era: WAIC 2025 as a Microcosm

The 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai served as a global unveiling of this new reality. The event transcended its role as a trade show, becoming a demonstration of China's operational dominance in Physical AI.

· From Prototypes to Participants: For the first time, robots moved from behind glass displays into active, functional roles—serving coffee, guiding visitors, and performing complex logistics tasks.
· A Show of Force: Over 150 humanoid robots from more than 80 companies performed real-world tasks on stage. Highlights included Unitree's G1 ($16,000) demonstrating fluid movement and UBTECH's Walker S performing delicate assembly-line manipulations.
· The Strategic Message: The conference made China's bet explicit: as the West refines conversational AI, China is building intelligent bodies. The focus has moved from models that think to systems that do.

II. The Three Pillars of Chinese Leadership

Pillar 1: Robotics – Overwhelming Industrial Dominance

China's leadership is built on scale, speed, and a rapidly closing innovation gap.

Metric China's Position (2024-2025) Global Context
Annual Installations 295,000 units (2024) 50%of global total since 2021.
Robot Stock 2.027 million units (EoY 2024) Over half of global operational stock.
Robot Density 470 robots per 10,000 workers (2023) Quadrupled since 2017; surpasses US (295), Germany (429), Japan (419); trails only South Korea (1,012).
Domestic Market Share 57% of domestic sales from local makers (2024) A historic tipping point for supply chain autonomy.
Humanoid Innovation 61% of new global humanoid models since 2022. Morgan Stanley's "Humanoid 100" (2025) notes 56% of leading humanoid firms are Chinese.
Investment & Cost ¥50Bn ($7Bn) investment in 9M 2025 (+250% YoY). Manufacturing costs down 40% YoY. Unitree R1 launched at $5,900, shattering price expectations.

The Price War & Scale Targets: The sub-$6,000 humanoid marks a "Model T moment." Chinese production targets for 2025 (e.g., Agibot: 5,000 units, BYD: 1,500 for internal use) outpace most Western rivals, focusing on immediate commercial and industrial deployment.

Pillar 2: Autonomous Mobility – Leading the Legal Deployment of Level 3

China's automotive revolution has evolved from electrification to autonomy.

· Scale Foundation: BYD sold 4.27 million electric vehicles in 2024, providing a vast platform for integration.
· Regulatory Lead: China is a global leader in certifying Level 3 autonomous vehicles for commercial production, allowing "hands-off, eyes-off" driving under conditions.
· Technology Stack: Companies are deploying integrated systems:
  · Xpeng: In-house Turing AI chip for advanced driver-assistance.
  · BYD: TianShen system deployed at scale.
  · Baidu Apollo: Fully driverless robotaxis operating in Wuhan, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai.
· Next Frontier: EHang's eVTOLs (autonomous aerial vehicles) commenced pilot commercial urban flights in 2025.

Pillar 3: Artificial Intelligence – An Ecosystem Built for Action

China's AI ecosystem is diverging from the Western path, prioritizing real-world utility.

· Research Output: Contributes 25% of global AI scientific publications, with dominant presence at top conferences.
· Focus on Agents: Shifting focus from massive LLMs to autonomous AI agents. The standout example is Manus (launched Mar 2025), an AI system that executes complex physical-world tasks (e.g., online shopping and storage) by coordinating vision, reasoning, and robotic control.
· Structural Investment in Talent:
  · 1.2 million students trained annually in AI-related disciplines.
  · AI education integrated into primary school curricula.
  · ¥138 Billion in public/private funds supporting AI/robotics.
  · Over 25,000 patents filed annually in the field.

III. The Semiconductor Foundation: Overcoming the Bottleneck

Faced with Western restrictions on advanced equipment (EUV lithography), China has adopted a "brute force" strategy of innovation and scale to power its Physical AI ambitions.

Challenge Chinese Response & 2025 Status Impact on Physical AI
Advanced Manufacturing SMIC achieves 5nm volume production using multi-patterning DUV. 7nm process is mature and stable. Enables high-performance, power-efficient "on-board brains" for robots and vehicles.
High-Performance Compute (HPU) Huawei Ascend 910C provides a viable domestic alternative to NVIDIA for AI training/inference. Secures the computational foundation for developing next-generation embodied AI models.
Specialized AI Silicon Cambricon Siyuan 590 and others provide chips optimized for robotics vision and sensor fusion. Powers the real-time perception and decision-making required in dynamic physical environments.
Automotive Silicon Xpeng (Turing), BYD (in-house) develop proprietary chips for autonomous driving. Insulates the automotive AI supply chain from external shocks.
Software Philosophy "Efficiency over Raw Power" – Aggressive software-hardware co-optimization to run complex models on mature nodes. Allows a $5,900 robot to perform tasks rivaling far more expensive prototypes, enabling mass adoption.

Conclusion: China has built a good enough, secure, and scalable semiconductor foundation specifically tailored to the needs of Physical AI, turning a perceived bottleneck into a strategic advantage rooted in supply chain sovereignty.

IV. Geopolitical Context: The Great Divergence in Strategy

This technological surge is not accidental but a direct component of national strategy.

· The Driving Force: Technological Autonomy. In response to U.S. export controls on advanced chips and equipment, China has accelerated its "dual circulation" policy, aiming for self-reliance in core technologies.
· The Strategic Pivot: Recognizing a persistent gap in chasing Western LLM scale, China changed the playing field to Physical AI, where its strengths in manufacturing, supply chains, and rapid iteration are paramount.
· Two Competing Philosophies:
  · U.S. & West ("Brain-First"): Pursuit of General Purpose AI/AGI. Focus on foundational model reasoning capability and high-complexity software innovation (e.g., Tesla's end-to-end neural networks).
  · China ("Body-First"): Pursuit of Vertical Task AI. Focus on hardware iteration, cost reduction, and solving specific, high-value industrial and service tasks. Leverages the world's largest market as a testing ground.
