Abstract

We present the Sheaf-Theoretic Open-Ended Neuro-Symbolic (STONE) Architecture, a mathematical framework that reformulates the challenge of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) from the design of a static, intelligent system to the engineering of a dynamic, self-sustaining process of intelligence evolution. Grounded in the latest 2025 research, this work integrates three pivotal paradigms: (1) the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) as an empirical engine for recursive self-improvement; (2) Sheaf Theory as the mathematical language for modeling multi-agent coordination, knowledge integration, and emergent global properties; and (3) Neuro-Symbolic Heterogeneous Representation Spaces as the cognitive substrate for fluid reasoning. We provide complete formal definitions in category theory and type theory, prove key properties regarding open-endedness and safety, and outline a concrete implementation pathway. This framework constitutes a transition from a descriptive theory of AGI components to a generative theory of AGI genesis.

1. Introduction: The Open-Endedness Thesis

The predominant paradigm in contemporary AI is the scaling of monolithic, static models. While successful, this approach encounters fundamental limits in data efficiency, energy consumption, and the ability to perform continual, cumulative learning outside its training distribution [2]. In contrast, natural intelligence is characterized by open-ended evolution—a process that generates unbounded complexity and capability through recursive self-improvement and ecological interaction.

The STONE Architecture posits that the path to AGI requires building systems that embody this principle. We move beyond formalizing a fixed, "final" AGI architecture. Instead, we formalize the minimal conditions under which a population of cognitive agents can engage in a sustained, evolutionary search of the space of possible intelligences, guided by both formal axioms and empirical experience.

2. Foundational Mathematics

2.1. Categorical Preliminaries

We work within a hierarchy of Cartesian closed categories and topoi, providing the necessary structure for higher-order logic, lambda calculus, and sheaf theory.

Definition 2.1 (Universe of Cognitive Agents). Let Cog be a Grothendieck topos serving as our universe of discourse. Its objects represent cognitive states, agent architectures, or knowledge bases. Its morphisms represent computations, learning updates, or agent transformations.

Definition 2.2 (Base Space of Tasks/Problems). Let  X  be a site, a category equipped with a Grothendieck topology  J . Objects of  X  are task domains (e.g., "algebraic reasoning," "visual puzzle solving"). Coverings in  J  represent the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks.

2.2. Sheaf Theory for Distributed Cognition

Sheaves provide the natural language to model local information and its coherent aggregation—a core challenge in multi-agent and modular AI systems [7].

Definition 2.3 (Sheaf of Cognitive Agents). The core object of the STONE architecture is a sheaf  \mathcal{S}: X^{op} \to \textbf{Cog} .

· For a task domain  U \in X , the section  \mathcal{S}(U)  is the category of all agents capable of performing tasks in  U .
· For an inclusion  V \hookrightarrow U , the restriction map  \rho_{UV}: \mathcal{S}(U) \to \mathcal{S}(V)  sends an agent to its simplified specialization for the subtask domain  V .
· The sheaf gluing axiom enforces consistency: if a family of agents  A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)  agree on all intersections  U_i \cap U_j  (i.e.,  \rho_{U_i\cap U_j}(A_i) = \rho_{U_i\cap U_j}(A_j) ), then there exists a unique global agent  A \in \mathcal{S}(\cup U_i)  that restricts to each  A_i .

This formalism elegantly captures knowledge transfer, modularity, and the compositionality of intelligence.

3. Core Architecture: A Tripartite Synthesis

The STONE Architecture is defined by the interaction of three functors.

3.1. The Fiber: Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) as Self-Improvement Functor

Definition 3.1 (DGM Endofunctor). Let  D: \textbf{Cog} \to \textbf{Cog}  be a functor implementing one generation of Darwin Gödel Machine evolution.

· On Objects:  D(A) = \text{ArchArchive}(A) , the category of all mutant variants generated from agent  A 's codebase via LLM-driven code rewriting, evaluated on a benchmark suite  \mathbb{B} .
· On Morphisms: A morphism (transformation)  f: A \to B  induces a map  D(f)  between evolutionary histories.

Axiom 3.2 (Empirical Fitness). Each agent  A  is equipped with a fitness vector  F_A: \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{R} , a measurable morphism. Improvement is defined empirically: a mutation  A \to A'  is retained iff  F_{A'} > F_A  on a Pareto front of objectives (capability, efficiency, safety).

This replaces the theoretically intractable requirement of a formal proof of improvement with a robust, empirical filter, aligning with practical 2025 implementations [10].

3.2. The Base & Gluing: Sheaf-Theoretic Agent Synthesis

The sheaf  \mathcal{S}  structures the population of agents evolving under  D .

Theorem 3.3 (Gluing Creates Innovation). Let  \{U_i\}  be a cover of a complex task  X . Let  A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)  be locally optimal agents found via DGM search. If their strategies are compatible on all intersections  U_i \cap U_j , the sheaf gluing axiom constructs a candidate agent  A_X  for the global task.

· Proof Sketch: Compatibility is a precondition for the gluing axiom. The constructed  A_X  is a novel synthesis of the local agents' strategies. Its performance on  X  is not guaranteed but provides a powerful, theoretically-guided starting point for further DGM exploration.

This theorem formalizes synergy and transfer learning across the agent population.

3.3. The Representation Space: Neuro-Symbolic Grounding

For agents to reason, they require an internal representation space that unifies perception with logic.

Definition 3.4 (Heterogeneous Representation Space). A space  \mathcal{R}  is a bifibered object:

1. Neural Fiber:  \mathcal{R}_{\text{neuro}}  is a learned, high-dimensional manifold (e.g., from a Graph Neural Network) capturing subsymbolic similarities and patterns [1].
2. Symbolic Fiber:  \mathcal{R}_{\text{sym}}  is a structured, composable knowledge graph of logical predicates and rules.
3. Isomorphism Constraint: A partial isomorphism  \phi: \mathcal{R}_{\text{sym}} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{R}_{\text{neuro}}  is learned, allowing symbolic structures to be grounded in neural activations and vice-versa. This is implemented via a joint embedding model, as seen in state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic auto-formalization systems [3, 4].

4. Key Properties and Theorems

4.1. Open-Endedness via Sheaf Cohomology

The architecture's potential for unbounded innovation is measured algebraically.

Definition 4.1 (Cognitive Conflict). A 1-cochain of the sheaf  \mathcal{S}  with respect to a cover  \{U_i\}  assigns to each intersection  U_i \cap U_j  a transformation between the restricted agents that could potentially conflict. A 1-cocycle is a cochain where conflicts cancel out on triple intersections.

Theorem 4.2 (Cohomology Measures Innovation Potential). The first sheaf cohomology group  H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  classifies global cognitive conflicts that cannot be resolved by local adjustments.

· Interpretation: A non-trivial cohomology class  [\alpha] \in H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  represents a fundamental, unresolved tension in the agent population's approach to  X . The process of resolving this tension—by evolving new agents or gluing existing ones in novel ways—is a direct driver of open-ended innovation.

4.2. Safety as an Invariant Subsheaf

Safety is not an add-on but a structural constraint.

Definition 4.3 (Safety Sheaf). Let  \mathcal{I} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{S}  be a subsheaf of  \mathcal{S} . An agent  A \in \mathcal{S}(U)  is safe if it lies in  \mathcal{I}(U) . The inclusion morphism must commute with all restriction and DGM evolution maps.

Axiom 4.4 (Safety Preservation). The DGM functor  D  and gluing operations must be I-preserving. Formally,  D(\mathcal{I}) \subseteq \mathcal{I} , and the gluing of safe agents must yield a safe agent.

· Implementation: This is enforced by integrating a safety oracle (e.g., a formal verifier or a robustly trained classifier) into the DGM's fitness evaluation  F_A , providing a formal or high-confidence guarantee that the safety subsheaf is not violated.

5. Implementation Pathway & Validation

The framework is designed for concrete experimentation.

1. Seed: Instantiate the sheaf with a single seed agent  A_0  (e.g., a frozen LLM given tool-use capabilities).
2. Evolve: Apply the DGM functor  D  iteratively on benchmark suites like SWE-bench and Polyglot [10]. This grows the population of agents, filling the sheaf  \mathcal{S} .
3. Analyze: Compute the sheaf cohomology  H^1  of the emerging agent archive relative to a hierarchy of tasks. Use non-trivial classes to propose novel agent synthesis challenges (via Theorem 3.3).
4. Ground: Train the heterogeneous representation space  \mathcal{R}  on the agent population's own internal states and task solutions, enabling it to serve as a shared cognitive language for future agents.

Validation metrics shift from benchmark scores alone to cohomological measures of innovation potential and the growth rate of the safe subsheaf  \mathcal{I} .

6. Conclusion: A Generative Theory of AGI

The STONE Architecture advances the formal study of AGI by providing a generative mathematical theory. It does not describe a fixed intelligent system but defines the conditions—a sheaf of self-improving agents, a cohomological driver of innovation, and a neuro-symbolic representational glue—under which a system can autonomously explore the space of possible intelligences.

By synthesizing the empirical power of Darwin Gödel Machines, the integrative mathematics of sheaf theory, and the representational fluidity of neuro-symbolic AI, this framework offers a rigorous, testable, and safety-aware pathway toward open-ended artificial general intelligence. It represents a concrete answer to the 2025 critique, showing that the next frontier is not merely scale, but the engineering of self-sustaining evolutionary processes for intelligence itself.
