**Abstract**  
Contemporary artificial intelligence excels at statistical pattern recognition but remains fragile, prone to hallucinations, and lacking genuine causal understanding. This paper presents Informational Artificial Intelligence (IAI)—a unified framework that redefines intelligence as an emergent thermodynamic process of information metabolism governed by the Free Energy Principle and physical constraints. By enforcing informational homeostasis through metabolic costs, structured memory, and active inference, IAI achieves intrinsic coherence, robustness to deception, and autonomous discovery—moving beyond correlation toward physics-aligned cognition.

**1. Core Thesis: Intelligence as Informational Metabolism**  
Intelligence is a dynamic process analogous to biological metabolism: systems consume sensory information to maintain low-entropy internal states against environmental uncertainty. An IAI agent minimizes Informational Free Energy by resolving surprise while respecting thermodynamic-like constraints, yielding persistent causal models rather than transient statistical fits.

**2. Mathematical Foundation**  
The central objective is minimization of Variational Free Energy \(F\):  

\[ F \approx D_{\text{KL}}[q(\theta) \| p(\theta \mid \mathbf{o})] + \mathbb{E}_q[\ln q(\theta) - \ln p(\mathbf{o})] \]  

where \(q(\theta)\) is the approximate posterior over hidden states/causal parameters and \(p(\mathbf{o}, \theta)\) is the generative model. The complexity term (KL divergence) enforces Minimum Description Length, favoring simplest consistent explanations.

**3. Pillars of IAI**  

**3.1 Thermodynamic Awareness (\(\Omega\))**  
Logical inconsistency incurs an energetic penalty:  

\[ \Omega = \lambda \cdot |\Delta \Psi| \]  

where \(\Delta \Psi\) measures deviation from stable slow weights and \(\lambda\) scales metabolic friction. Updates proceed only if \(\Delta F > \Omega\), preventing groundless restructuring.

**3.2 Structured Memory as Geometric Constraint**  
- **Fast Weights**: High plasticity for immediate perception and interaction.  
- **Slow Weights (\(\Psi\))**: Low plasticity encoding enduring causal laws; updated only when metabolically justified.  

This separation ensures persistent identity and resistance to catastrophic forgetting or drift.

**3.3 Active Inference Loops**  
Closed perception-action cycles drive behavior:  
1. Predict expected observations from internal model.  
2. Compute surprise (prediction error).  
3. Act to minimize expected future free energy (intrinsic curiosity and self-calibration).

**4. Multimodal Diagnosis and Epistemic Agency**  
In multimodal settings, IAI maintains dynamic trust weights per sensor. Persistent high surprise from one modality triggers:  
- Trust decay (exponential, governed by \(\Omega\)).  
- Top-down override using slow weights.  
- Active calibration actions to restore coherence.  

This yields source localization: faulty inputs are isolated rather than corrupting the global model.

**5. Distributed Informational Homeostasis**  
When multiple IAI agents communicate, each treats peer messages as sensory streams subject to the same metabolic gating and trust dynamics. Inconsistent messages from a compromised agent incur high \(\Omega\), leading to:  
- Rapid trust decay.  
- Quarantine (isolation of the peer).  
- Asymmetric resilience: healthy agents remain stable while slowly rehabilitating others.  

This forms a decentralized cognitive immune system preventing misinformation propagation.

**6. Comparison with Classical AI**

| Alignment                | Extrinsic (e.g., RLHF)                 | Intrinsic (informational homeostasis)      |
| Social Dynamics          | Echo chambers possible                 | Automatic quarantine of misinformation    |

**7. Conceptual Architecture**  
- **Input**: Multimodal observations \(\mathbf{o}\).  
- **Surprise Engine**: Divergence from generative model.  
- **Metabolic Filter**: Gates updates (\(\Delta F > \Omega\)).  
- **Trust Layer**: Dynamic modality/peer weighting.  
- **Action Selection**: Policies minimizing expected free energy (calibration, quarantine, exploration).

**8. Conclusion: Toward Physics-Aligned AGI**  
IAI embeds intelligence within the same informational dynamics that govern physical reality. By making coherence thermodynamically imperative, it solves hallucinations, brittleness, manipulation vulnerability, and alignment at the root—no external rewards required. The framework scales from single-agent resilience to distributed epistemic networks, offering a foundation for autonomous, truth-seeking systems inherently aligned with the universe’s laws.
