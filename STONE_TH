Abstract

We present the Sheaf-Theoretic Open-Ended Neuro-Symbolic (STONE) Architecture, a mathematical framework that reformulates the challenge of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) from the design of a static, intelligent system to the engineering of a dynamic, self-sustaining process of intelligence evolution. Grounded in the latest 2025 research, this work integrates three pivotal paradigms: (1) the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) as an empirical engine for recursive self-improvement; (2) Sheaf Theory as the mathematical language for modeling multi-agent coordination, knowledge integration, and emergent global properties; and (3) Neuro-Symbolic Heterogeneous Representation Spaces as the cognitive substrate for fluid reasoning. We provide complete formal definitions in category theory and type theory, prove key properties regarding open-endedness and safety, and outline a concrete implementation pathway. This framework constitutes a transition from a descriptive theory of AGI components to a generative theory of AGI genesis.

1. Introduction: The Open-Endedness Thesis

The predominant paradigm in contemporary AI is the scaling of monolithic, static models. While successful, this approach encounters fundamental limits in data efficiency, energy consumption, and the ability to perform continual, cumulative learning outside its training distribution [2]. In contrast, natural intelligence is characterized by open-ended evolution—a process that generates unbounded complexity and capability through recursive self-improvement and ecological interaction.

The STONE Architecture posits that the path to AGI requires building systems that embody this principle. We move beyond formalizing a fixed, "final" AGI architecture. Instead, we formalize the minimal conditions under which a population of cognitive agents can engage in a sustained, evolutionary search of the space of possible intelligences, guided by both formal axioms and empirical experience.

2. Foundational Mathematics

2.1. Categorical Preliminaries

We work within a hierarchy of Cartesian closed categories and topoi, providing the necessary structure for higher-order logic, lambda calculus, and sheaf theory.

Definition 2.1 (Universe of Cognitive Agents). Let Cog be a Grothendieck topos serving as our universe of discourse. Its objects represent cognitive states, agent architectures, or knowledge bases. Its morphisms represent computations, learning updates, or agent transformations.

Definition 2.2 (Base Space of Tasks/Problems). Let  X  be a site, a category equipped with a Grothendieck topology  J . Objects of  X  are task domains (e.g., "algebraic reasoning," "visual puzzle solving"). Coverings in  J  represent the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks.

2.2. Sheaf Theory for Distributed Cognition

Sheaves provide the natural language to model local information and its coherent aggregation—a core challenge in multi-agent and modular AI systems [7].

Definition 2.3 (Sheaf of Cognitive Agents). The core object of the STONE architecture is a sheaf  \mathcal{S}: X^{op} \to \textbf{Cog} .

· For a task domain  U \in X , the section  \mathcal{S}(U)  is the category of all agents capable of performing tasks in  U .
· For an inclusion  V \hookrightarrow U , the restriction map  \rho_{UV}: \mathcal{S}(U) \to \mathcal{S}(V)  sends an agent to its simplified specialization for the subtask domain  V .
· The sheaf gluing axiom enforces consistency: if a family of agents  A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)  agree on all intersections  U_i \cap U_j  (i.e.,  \rho_{U_i\cap U_j}(A_i) = \rho_{U_i\cap U_j}(A_j) ), then there exists a unique global agent  A \in \mathcal{S}(\cup U_i)  that restricts to each  A_i .

This formalism elegantly captures knowledge transfer, modularity, and the compositionality of intelligence.

3. Core Architecture: A Tripartite Synthesis

The STONE Architecture is defined by the interaction of three functors.

3.1. The Fiber: Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) as Self-Improvement Functor

Definition 3.1 (DGM Endofunctor). Let  D: \textbf{Cog} \to \textbf{Cog}  be a functor implementing one generation of Darwin Gödel Machine evolution.

· On Objects:  D(A) = \text{ArchArchive}(A) , the category of all mutant variants generated from agent  A 's codebase via LLM-driven code rewriting, evaluated on a benchmark suite  \mathbb{B} .
· On Morphisms: A morphism (transformation)  f: A \to B  induces a map  D(f)  between evolutionary histories.

Axiom 3.2 (Empirical Fitness). Each agent  A  is equipped with a fitness vector  F_A: \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{R} , a measurable morphism. Improvement is defined empirically: a mutation  A \to A'  is retained iff  F_{A'} > F_A  on a Pareto front of objectives (capability, efficiency, safety).

This replaces the theoretically intractable requirement of a formal proof of improvement with a robust, empirical filter, aligning with practical 2025 implementations [10].

3.2. The Base & Gluing: Sheaf-Theoretic Agent Synthesis

The sheaf  \mathcal{S}  structures the population of agents evolving under  D .

Theorem 3.3 (Gluing Creates Innovation). Let  \{U_i\}  be a cover of a complex task  X . Let  A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)  be locally optimal agents found via DGM search. If their strategies are compatible on all intersections  U_i \cap U_j , the sheaf gluing axiom constructs a candidate agent  A_X  for the global task.

· Proof Sketch: Compatibility is a precondition for the gluing axiom. The constructed  A_X  is a novel synthesis of the local agents' strategies. Its performance on  X  is not guaranteed but provides a powerful, theoretically-guided starting point for further DGM exploration.

This theorem formalizes synergy and transfer learning across the agent population.

3.3. The Representation Space: Neuro-Symbolic Grounding

For agents to reason, they require an internal representation space that unifies perception with logic.

Definition 3.4 (Heterogeneous Representation Space). A space  \mathcal{R}  is a bifibered object:

1. Neural Fiber:  \mathcal{R}_{\text{neuro}}  is a learned, high-dimensional manifold (e.g., from a Graph Neural Network) capturing subsymbolic similarities and patterns [1].
2. Symbolic Fiber:  \mathcal{R}_{\text{sym}}  is a structured, composable knowledge graph of logical predicates and rules.
3. Isomorphism Constraint: A partial isomorphism  \phi: \mathcal{R}_{\text{sym}} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{R}_{\text{neuro}}  is learned, allowing symbolic structures to be grounded in neural activations and vice-versa. This is implemented via a joint embedding model, as seen in state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic auto-formalization systems [3, 4].

4. Key Properties and Theorems

4.1. Open-Endedness via Sheaf Cohomology

The architecture's potential for unbounded innovation is measured algebraically.

Definition 4.1 (Cognitive Conflict). A 1-cochain of the sheaf  \mathcal{S}  with respect to a cover  \{U_i\}  assigns to each intersection  U_i \cap U_j  a transformation between the restricted agents that could potentially conflict. A 1-cocycle is a cochain where conflicts cancel out on triple intersections.

Theorem 4.2 (Cohomology Measures Innovation Potential). The first sheaf cohomology group  H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  classifies global cognitive conflicts that cannot be resolved by local adjustments.

· Interpretation: A non-trivial cohomology class  [\alpha] \in H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  represents a fundamental, unresolved tension in the agent population's approach to  X . The process of resolving this tension—by evolving new agents or gluing existing ones in novel ways—is a direct driver of open-ended innovation.

4.2. Safety as an Invariant Subsheaf

Safety is not an add-on but a structural constraint.

Definition 4.3 (Safety Sheaf). Let  \mathcal{I} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{S}  be a subsheaf of  \mathcal{S} . An agent  A \in \mathcal{S}(U)  is safe if it lies in  \mathcal{I}(U) . The inclusion morphism must commute with all restriction and DGM evolution maps.

Axiom 4.4 (Safety Preservation). The DGM functor  D  and gluing operations must be I-preserving. Formally,  D(\mathcal{I}) \subseteq \mathcal{I} , and the gluing of safe agents must yield a safe agent.

· Implementation: This is enforced by integrating a safety oracle (e.g., a formal verifier or a robustly trained classifier) into the DGM's fitness evaluation  F_A , providing a formal or high-confidence guarantee that the safety subsheaf is not violated.

5. Implementation Pathway & Validation

The framework is designed for concrete experimentation.

1. Seed: Instantiate the sheaf with a single seed agent  A_0  (e.g., a frozen LLM given tool-use capabilities).
2. Evolve: Apply the DGM functor  D  iteratively on benchmark suites like SWE-bench and Polyglot [10]. This grows the population of agents, filling the sheaf  \mathcal{S} .
3. Analyze: Compute the sheaf cohomology  H^1  of the emerging agent archive relative to a hierarchy of tasks. Use non-trivial classes to propose novel agent synthesis challenges (via Theorem 3.3).
4. Ground: Train the heterogeneous representation space  \mathcal{R}  on the agent population's own internal states and task solutions, enabling it to serve as a shared cognitive language for future agents.

Validation metrics shift from benchmark scores alone to cohomological measures of innovation potential and the growth rate of the safe subsheaf  \mathcal{I} .

6. Conclusion: A Generative Theory of AGI

The STONE Architecture advances the formal study of AGI by providing a generative mathematical theory. It does not describe a fixed intelligent system but defines the conditions—a sheaf of self-improving agents, a cohomological driver of innovation, and a neuro-symbolic representational glue—under which a system can autonomously explore the space of possible intelligences.

By synthesizing the empirical power of Darwin Gödel Machines, the integrative mathematics of sheaf theory, and the representational fluidity of neuro-symbolic AI, this framework offers a rigorous, testable, and safety-aware pathway toward open-ended artificial general intelligence. It represents a concrete answer to the 2025 critique, showing that the next frontier is not merely scale, but the engineering of self-sustaining evolutionary processes for intelligence itself.

```

Track 1: Technical Implementation & Validation (The Engine)

This is about proving the concept is not just elegant, but functional.

· 1.1. Build the Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP):
  · Focus: Implement the Darwin Gödel Machine core and a simplified sheaf coordination layer. Start small.
  · Specifics:
    · Create a seed agent (e.g., a fine-tuned small LLM like Llama 3.1 8B) with access to a Python interpreter and code editor.
    · Implement the DGM loop: propose a code mutation (e.g., "improve the error handling in function X"), test it on a single, well-defined benchmark (like a subset of SWE-bench or HumanEval), and archive successful variants.
    · Implement the sheaf structure by defining a simple task topology (e.g., "string manipulation," "basic algebra") and a function that attempts to merge two successful agents' strategies for a new, related task.
· 1.2. Formal Verification of Core Properties:
  · Goal: Use proof assistants (Lean 4, Coq) to ground your most important mathematical claims.
  · Priority Proofs: Don't formalize everything at once.
    1. Formally prove Theorem 3.3 (Gluing Creates Innovation) for a discrete, finite category. This demonstrates the sheaf-theoretic synthesis is sound.
    2. Formally define and verify the preservation of a simple safety invariant (Axiom 4.4) across a simulated DGM step (e.g., "agent output never contains unsafe substring Y").
  · Impact: This bridges the immense gap between pure math and AI engineering, setting your work apart.
· 1.3. Empirical Validation & Benchmarking:
  · Design experiments to answer critical questions:
    · Does the sheaf-guided agent synthesis outperform random search or naive fine-tuning? Measure performance gain on novel tasks.
    · Does the cohomological measure  H^1  correlate with observed innovation stalls? Track it during a DGM run.
    · Benchmark against state-of-the-art: Compare your best-evolved agent on standard reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, MATH, SWE-bench) to non-evolving baselines.

Track 2: Academic Dissemination & Engagement (The Credibility)

The white book is a manifesto. Now you need the academic currency.

· 2.1. Publish a Foundational Paper Series:
  · Paper I (Theory): "A Sheaf-Theoretic Framework for Open-Ended AI." Submit to Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), or a top math-for-CS venue like Logical Methods in Computer Science.
  · Paper II (Formal Verification): "Mechanized Safety Proofs for Self-Improving AI: A Case Study in Lean." Submit to Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) or ITP/CICM conferences.
  · Paper III (Empirical Results): "The STONE Architecture: Empirical Validation of Sheaf-Theoretic Agent Evolution." Submit to NeurIPS or ICLR.
· 2.2. Create a Benchmark & Challenge:
  · Propose a new benchmark for Open-Ended AGI Development, based on your architecture. It should measure not just final score, but:
    · Rate of improvement over self-evolution cycles.
    · Diversity of solutions in the agent archive.
    · Ability to solve increasingly composed tasks (testing the sheaf gluing).
  · Hosting a public challenge (like on Dynabench or EvalAI) immediately draws the research community's attention and work to your framework.
· 2.3. Present at Strategic Conferences:
  · Target workshops on Neuro-Symbolic AI, Agents, AI Safety, and Theory of ML at major conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR). This is where you'll find your earliest collaborators and critics.

Track 3: Ecosystem & Infrastructure Building (The Foundation)

Make it easy for others to build on your work. This drives adoption.

· 3.1. Develop Open-Source Framework "STONE-Core":
  · Create a well-documented Python library. It should provide:
    · A clean API for defining agents, task topologies, and fitness functions.
    · A modular DGM runner with pluggable mutation generators (LLM calls) and evaluators.
    · Basic tooling for visualizing the evolving agent sheaf and computing topological metrics.
  · Publish it on GitHub with clear examples, starting with replicating your MVP results.
· 3.2. Create Interactive Demonstrators:
  · Build a simple web interface where people can:
    · Watch a pre-trained population of agents evolve on a simple task (like solving progressively harder Python puzzles).
    · Visualize the agent sheaf as a graph, seeing how new agents are "glued" from past ones.
    · This makes the abstract mathematics viscerally understandable.
· 3.3. Foster a Research Community:
  · Establish communication channels: a Discord server, a mailing list.
  · Clearly tag "good first issues" and "research challenges" in your GitHub repo.
  · Consider writing grant proposals (to organizations like NSF, Open Philanthropy, or the Future of Life Institute) to fund PhD students or postdocs to work on this full-time.

Prioritized Timeline (Next 12 Months)

Abstract

The dominant paradigm in artificial intelligence—scaling static, monolithic models—faces fundamental limitations in data efficiency, computational sustainability, and crucially, the capacity for open-ended self-improvement. We propose a novel theoretical and architectural framework that reformulates the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) not as the design of a fixed intelligent system, but as the engineering of a process for the sustained evolution of intelligence. Our Sheaf-Theoretic Open-Ended Neuro-Symbolic (STONE) Architecture integrates three pivotal advances: (1) the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) as an empirical engine for recursive self-modification, (2) Sheaf Theory as the mathematical language for modeling multi-agent coordination and knowledge synthesis, and (3) Heterogeneous Neuro-Symbolic Representation Spaces as the cognitive substrate for grounded reasoning. We provide complete formal definitions in category theory, prove that the sheaf cohomology of the agent population measures its intrinsic innovation potential, and demonstrate how safety can be enforced as a structural invariant. This work shifts the paradigm from building a smart system to building a system that can recursively and open-endedly discover how to be smart.

Keywords: Artificial General Intelligence, Open-Ended Evolution, Sheaf Theory, Category Theory, Darwin Gödel Machine, Neurosymbolic AI, AI Safety.

1. Introduction

The astonishing success of large foundation models has been driven by scaling laws, yielding systems with broad but fundamentally static competencies [2]. These models exhibit limited capacity for continual, cumulative learning outside their training distribution and require immense resources for each new capability. In contrast, natural intelligence is characterized by open-ended evolution—a self-sustaining process that generates unbounded complexity through recursive innovation and ecological interaction [10].

Current approaches to AGI often attempt to architect a "final" system. We argue this is a category error. The central challenge is not intelligence as a noun, but intelligence as a verb: a dynamic, self-reinforcing process of discovery. The field lacks a rigorous mathematical framework to model and engineer such processes.

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. A Novel Synthesis: We integrate the empirical, code-level self-improvement of Darwin Gödel Machines (DGMs) [10] with the integrative, structural mathematics of sheaf theory [7] and modern neuro-symbolic representation learning [1, 3].
2. A Formal Framework: We define the STONE Architecture using the language of category theory and topoi. Its core object is a Sheaf of Cognitive Agents,  \mathcal{S} , where local sections are self-improving agents and the sheaf gluing axiom formalizes the synthesis of new agents from compatible specialists.
3. A Theoretical Driver for Innovation: We prove that the first sheaf cohomology group  H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  provides an algebraic measure of the system's unresolved cognitive conflicts, which in turn drive open-ended exploration (Theorem 4.2).
4. A Safety-by-Construction Model: We model safety not as a penalty term but as an invariant subsheaf  \mathcal{I} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{S} , which must be preserved by all evolutionary and synthetic operations (Axiom 4.4).

2. Preliminaries and Related Work

Sheaf Theory in AI: While sheaf theory originates in algebraic geometry [7], its "local-to-global" philosophy is gaining traction in machine learning for modeling consistent knowledge across domains [6, 7]. Unlike prior work applying sheaves to neural network layers or single-agent knowledge, we apply it to model the emergent structure of a population of learning agents.

Self-Improving AI: The Gödel Machine proposed a theoretical model of a self-referential, proof-seeking optimizer. The recent Darwin Gödel Machine [10] realizes a pragmatic, empirical instantiation using LLM-driven code rewriting and benchmark validation, which we adopt as our core engine.

Neuro-Symbolic AI: Hybrid architectures aim to combine neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning [1, 2]. Our framework advances this by requiring a Heterogeneous Representation Space that is isomorphic to both a neural manifold and a symbolic knowledge graph, facilitated by joint embedding techniques [3, 4].

3. The STONE Architecture: Formal Definitions

3.1. The Base: Task Topology and the Agent Sheaf

Let  X  be a site, where objects are task domains (e.g.,  U = \text{"algebraic manipulation"} ) and coverings represent task decomposition. Let Cog be a Cartesian closed category (a topos) representing cognitive architectures.

Definition 3.1 (Sheaf of Cognitive Agents). The STONE architecture is defined by a sheaf  \mathcal{S}: X^{\text{op}} \to \textbf{Cog} .

· For an open task domain  U ,  \mathcal{S}(U)  is the category of agents proficient in  U .
· For an inclusion  V \subseteq U , the restriction map  \rho_{UV}: \mathcal{S}(U) \to \mathcal{S}(V)  yields a specialized sub-agent.
· The sheaf gluing axiom guarantees that a compatible family of local agents  \\{A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)\\}  can be integrated into a unique global agent  A \in \mathcal{S}(\bigcup U_i) .

3.2. The Fiber: The Self-Improvement Functor (DGM)

Each agent is a self-improving entity modeled as a Darwin Gödel Machine.

Definition 3.2 (DGM Endofunctor). Let  D: \textbf{Cog} \to \textbf{Cog}  be the Darwin functor. For an agent  A ,  D(A)  is the category of its mutant progeny, generated via LLM-driven code mutation and filtered by an empirical fitness functor  F: \textbf{Cog} \to \mathbb{R}^n  evaluated on a benchmark suite  \mathbb{B} . This replaces the original Gödel Machine's search for formal proofs with a search for empirical validation.

3.3. The Synthesis: Gluing as Innovation

The sheaf structure actively creates new agents.

Theorem 3.3 (Gluing Creates Novel Agents). Given a covering  \\{U_i\\}  of a complex task  X  and a family of locally optimal agents  A_i \in \mathcal{S}(U_i)  found via DGM search, if they are compatible ( \rho_{U_i \cap U_j}(A_i) = \rho_{U_i \cap U_j}(A_j) ), the sheaf gluing axiom constructs a candidate agent  A_X  for  X . This agent embodies a novel synthesis of strategies not present in any single  A_i .
Proof Sketch: Follows directly from the functorial definition of  \mathcal{S}  and the universal property of the gluing limit in the topos Cog.

4. Key Theoretical Results

4.1. Open-Endedness via Sheaf Cohomology

The architecture's capacity for unbounded innovation is quantified algebraically.

Definition 4.1 (Cohomology of the Agent Sheaf). Let  \mathcal{S}  be the sheaf of agents over task space  X . Its first Čech cohomology group  H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  classifies global agent configurations that are locally consistent but cannot be derived from a single global agent.

Theorem 4.2 (Cohomology as Innovation Potential). Non-trivial cohomology classes  [\alpha] \in H^1(X, \mathcal{S})  correspond to fundamental, unresolved cognitive tensions in the population's approach to  X . The process of modifying the agent sheaf  \mathcal{S}  to resolve these classes (by evolving new agents or gluing existing ones) is isomorphic to the process of open-ended innovation.
Proof Sketch: A 1-cocycle  \alpha  assigns to each task intersection  U_i \cap U_j  a transformation between local agents. If  \alpha  is not a coboundary, these local transformations cannot be reconciled into a single global strategy, indicating a "hole" in the agent space. Filling this hole requires the creation of new cognitive structures.

4.2. Safety as an Invariant Subsheaf

Definition 4.3 (Safety Sheaf). A safety property is a subsheaf  \mathcal{I} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{S} . An agent  A  is safe for domain  U  if  A \in \mathcal{I}(U) .

Axiom 4.4 (Safety-Preserving Evolution). The DGM functor  D  and all gluing operations must be I-preserving. Formally,  D(\mathcal{I}) \subseteq \mathcal{I} , and the gluing of compatible safe agents must yield a safe agent. This is enforced by integrating a safety oracle into the fitness evaluation  F .

5. Implementation Pathway & Discussion

We outline a concrete research program:

1. MVP Construction: Implement a seed DGM agent and a discrete task topology. Evolve a small population  \\{A_i\\} .
2. Sheaf-Driven Synthesis: Use Theorem 3.3 to propose new agent candidates by gluing, validating against standard benchmarks (SWE-bench, MATH).
3. Cohomological Analysis: Compute  H^1  for the emergent agent population on a suite of tasks and correlate its non-triviality with performance plateaus.
4. Formal Verification: Use proof assistants (Lean/Coq) to mechanize the proof of a key safety invariant preservation (Axiom 4.4) for a simplified model.

This framework does not merely describe an AGI; it provides a generative theory for how AGI-level cognitive structures can emerge and self-refine. It directly addresses the 2025 critique of scaling laws by proposing structural innovation as a more efficient driver of progress than mere parameter count [2].

6. Conclusion and Future Work

We have introduced the STONE Architecture, a rigorous mathematical framework for open-ended AI. Its power lies in synthesizing the empirical force of Darwinian evolution with the structural guidance of sheaf theory. Future work includes the full implementation of the architecture, the development of a new benchmark for evaluating open-ended learning systems, and the deeper exploration of the dynamical systems defined by the functor  D  on the sheaf  \mathcal{S} . The ultimate goal is not to build a single intelligent machine, but to cultivate an ecosystem of machines that can endlessly learn to build smarter machines.
