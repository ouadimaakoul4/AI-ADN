EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: FIVE NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

All mission architectures must satisfy these first-order constraints with 20% margin:

1. ENERGY RESILIENCE: Maintain 25 kWe continuous power through 150-sol dust storm (τ>5)
2. ISRU FIDELITY: Produce 2 tonnes CH₄/LOX propellant before crew Earth departure
3. RADIATION SAFETY: ≤600 mSv effective dose for 500-day surface stay (NASA STD-3001)
4. ASCENT CERTAINTY: 99.9% probability of launch window from Martian surface
5. MEDICAL AUTONOMY: Treat trauma/surgical emergencies with 20-minute comm delay

Failure to meet any requirement disqualifies the architecture.

I. PLANETARY BASELINE (SYSTEMS SIZING)

Parameter Value Engineering Impact
Surface Gravity 3.711 m/s² (0.376 gₑ) Ascent ΔV: 4.1 km/s (surface→LMO). Structural loads at 38% Earth equivalent.
Atmospheric Pressure 0.636 kPa (avg) EVA suit minimum: 29.6 kPa. Habitat stress: 10.5 t/m² outward force.
Solar Insolation 589 W/m² (avg) PV output: 43% of Earth orbit. Critical: 99% attenuation during storms.
Orbital Eccentricity 0.0934 45% solar flux variation (aphelion→perihelion).
Axial Tilt 25.19° Polar night ≤180 days. Mid-latitudes (30-50°N) optimal for energy/access balance.
Regolith Depth 2-10 m (variable) Radiation shielding: 3 m = 1,000 g/cm² = ≤0.30 mSv/day.

Launch Windows: 26-month synodic cycle. Conjunction-class (900-1,000 days total) minimizes propulsion but maximizes exposure.

VII. ASCENT VEHICLE: TWO ARCHITECTURES

OPTION B: EARTH-DEPENDENT (CONTINGENCY)

· Propellant: MMH/NTO (hypergolic, Earth-supplied)
· ΔV: 3.8 km/s (lower Isp but storable)
· Mass Penalty: 5 tonnes landed mass per crew

DECISION GATE: ISRU propellant production demo (1 tonne) must succeed 26 months before crew launch.

VIII. PROGRAMMATIC REALITIES (2026)

1. MSR CANCELLATION IMPACT:

· Technology Gap: No U.S. Mars ascent/orbital rendezvous demo

· Launch: 2028
· Return: 2031
· Critical Demos: 2-meter drilling, ascent vehicle, orbital rendezvous
· International Payloads: 15 kg available (strategic collaboration opportunity)

3. GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE:

· China: First sample return likely (2031)
· ESA: LightShip philosophy favors modularity
· U.S.: Commercial partners + Artemis-derived technologies
· Recommendation: Design agnostic to launch provider, standard interfaces
