GeoCognitive Intelligence: A Unified Mathematical Framework for Self-Optimizing, Explainable, and Resilient Artificial General Intelligence


Author: Ouadi Maakoul


Abstract

This dissertation presents GeoCognitive Intelligence (GCI), a unified mathematical framework for Artificial General Intelligence that synthesizes four theoretical research programs: (i) brain‑inspired adaptive capsule networks with structural plasticity, (ii) archive‑based multimodal reasoning with causal grounding, (iii) categorical meta‑cognitive architectures with triune cognition, and (iv) self‑optimizing multi‑agent coordination with evolutionary dynamics.

The central thesis is that genuine intelligence—characterized by resilience, adaptability, understanding, and explainability—can be formally characterized through the geometric structure of cognitive processes coordinated through adjoint functors, grounded in causal evidence, and evolved through manifold‑based dynamics.

GCI introduces five core theoretical contributions:

1. The GeoCognitive Manifold: A Riemannian structure where cognitive states (capsules, concepts, agents) reside, with the Fisher information metric encoding representational sensitivity and geodesic distances measuring conceptual similarity. Precise statistical interpretations are provided for both capsule observation models and agent policy distributions.
2. The Triune Adjunction Monad: A categorical framework (CR ⇄ Mii ⇄ SP) with precise definitions for objects and morphisms in each category. We prove the existence of adjoint functors $F \dashv G$ and $P \dashv Q$ satisfying triangle identities, ensuring coherent bidirectional translation between conscious reasoning, subconscious intuition, and meta‑cognitive interpretation.
3. Archive‑Grounded Causal Semantics: An explicit construction of the archive sheaf on the site of temporal problems (intervals), with locality and gluing conditions ensuring global coherence. We prove that local reasoning steps based on archival evidence extend uniquely to globally consistent interpretations.
4. Dynamic Hierarchical Evolutionary Coordination: A game‑theoretic multi‑agent orchestration framework where agent teams form via Information Bottleneck selection and evolve via coupled stochastic differential equations. We prove convergence to Nash equilibria under mean‑field limits and cooling schedules, referencing McKean–Vlasov processes.
5. Axiomatic Explainability via Hierarchical Owen Values: A computationally feasible attribution method with proven error bounds for gradient approximations. We establish quantitative bounds for the deviation between gradient‑based attribution and true Owen values based on the smoothness of the value function.

The framework is grounded in differential geometry, category theory, information geometry, non‑equilibrium thermodynamics, and cooperative game theory. All core theorems are stated with complete proofs in the appendices. Key categorical properties are formalized in Lean 4 for machine‑checked verification, with a refined scope separating abstract categorical proofs from neural approximation guarantees.

GCI provides a theoretical foundation for understanding intelligence as a geometric‑categorical phenomenon and specifies architectural requirements for AGI systems that are resilient, adaptive, interpretable, and aligned with human values. The mathematical framework is released as open‑source formalizations to accelerate research in mathematically grounded artificial intelligence.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Motivation

1.1 The AGI Challenge: Beyond Pattern Matching

The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence remains a defining challenge of 21st‑century computer science and mathematics. While contemporary AI systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities in narrow domains—language modeling, computer vision, game playing—they fundamentally lack formal characterizations of the hallmarks of genuine intelligence:

· Resilience: The capacity to maintain function under perturbation, damage, or distribution shift.
· Adaptability: The ability to reorganize structure and strategy in response to novel tasks.
· Understanding: Grounded causal reasoning rather than statistical correlation.
· Explainability: Transparent attribution of decisions to interpretable components.
· Self‑improvement: Recursive application of cognitive strategies to cognition itself.

Current approaches largely pursue brute‑force scaling: more parameters, more data, more compute. While this yields incremental improvements, theoretical analysis suggests diminishing returns and fundamental limitations in opacity, brittleness, and energy consumption. This dissertation proposes that the future of AGI lies not in scaling monolithic models, but in architectures whose structure reflects the mathematical principles of intelligence itself.

1.2 Four Complementary Research Programs

This dissertation synthesizes four theoretical research programs, each addressing a critical dimension of intelligent systems:

Framework Core Insight Limitation Addressed
Adaptive Capsules Functional units with vector outputs enable rich part‑whole reasoning and structural plasticity via Hebbian/STDP rules. Static architectures lack dynamic self‑repair and functional redistribution after damage.
Archive‑Based AGI Historical archives provide causal ground truth with temporal density, provenance structure, and multimodal integration. Web‑scale data lacks temporal coherence, provenance tracking, and causal grounding.
Mii Meta‑Cognition Triune cognition (conscious/subconscious/meta) formalized as adjoint functors enables recursive self‑improvement with fixed‑point convergence. Shallow neuro‑symbolic hybrids lack genuine mutual adaptation and meta‑awareness.
DHEAF Coordination Multi‑agent systems coordinated via game theory, information bottleneck, and evolutionary dynamics scale intelligence efficiently with Owen‑value explainability. Ad‑hoc multi‑agent systems lack formal coordination guarantees and explainability.

Individually, each framework advances the theoretical state of the art. Together, they form a coherent whole: capsules provide the atomic cognitive units; archives provide the epistemic substrate; Mii provides the cognitive architecture; and DHEAF provides the orchestration framework for scaling.

1.3 The GeoCognitive Synthesis

The unifying insight of this dissertation is that intelligence is geometric: cognitive processes unfold on manifolds whose structure encodes representational relationships, learning dynamics, and coordination constraints. This geometric perspective enables:

· Unified representation: Capsules, concepts, and agents all reside on the GeoCognitive Manifold $\mathcal{M}$, with the Fisher information metric providing a common notion of distance and similarity.
· Coherent translation: Adjoint functors between cognitive levels ensure that insights flow bidirectionally without loss of meaning, with triangle identities guaranteeing coherence.
· Causal grounding: Sheaf‑theoretic semantics guarantee that local reasoning steps compose to globally consistent understanding.
· Efficient coordination: Geodesic flow on the agent manifold minimizes conflict and maximizes synergistic output.
· Provable safety: Formal verification of categorical properties ensures alignment and robustness.

1.4 Thesis Statement

This dissertation advances the hypothesis that Artificial General Intelligence requires a geometric‑categorical architecture that integrates:

1. Vector‑based functional units with structural plasticity (adaptive capsules with Hebbian/STDP rules and entropy‑based generation);
2. Causally grounded historical evidence (archive sheaves with provenance weighting and consistency conditions);
3. Triune meta‑cognitive translation (Mii adjunctions with fixed‑point convergence and insight detection);
4. Self‑optimizing multi‑agent coordination (DHEAF dynamics with Information Bottleneck selection and Owen‑value attribution).

We demonstrate that such an architecture admits rigorous mathematical treatment—including completeness theorems, fixed‑point convergence guarantees, and axiomatic explainability—and we provide formal specifications for implementation.

Chapter 2: Literature Review: Mathematical Foundations of AI

2.1 Adaptive Neural Architectures

2.1.1 Capsule Networks: From Scalar to Vector Representations

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent features as scalar activations, losing critical information about spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies. Hinton et al. (2018) introduced capsule networks to address this fundamental limitation. A capsule is a group of neurons whose output vector $\mathbf{u}_c \in \mathbb{R}^d$ encodes both the presence of an entity (via its norm) and its properties (via its orientation).

Definition 2.1.1 (Capsule). A capsule $c$ is a computational unit defined by:

· An output vector $\mathbf{u}_c = \|\mathbf{u}_c\| \cdot \hat{\mathbf{u}}_c$, where $\|\mathbf{u}_c\| \in [0,1]$ represents the probability of entity existence and $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_c$ encodes instantiation parameters (pose, scale, orientation).
· A transformation matrix $\mathbf{W}_{ij}$ that maps child capsule outputs to predictions for parent capsules.
· A routing mechanism that iteratively refines coupling coefficients $c_{ij}$ between capsules.

The dynamic routing algorithm iteratively updates coupling coefficients based on agreement:

b_{ij} \leftarrow b_{ij} + \mathbf{v}_j \cdot \hat{\mathbf{u}}_{j|i}

where $\hat{\mathbf{u}}_{j|i} = \mathbf{W}_{ij}\mathbf{u}_i$ is the prediction vector and $\mathbf{v}_j$ is the parent capsule output. Yang et al. (2025) proved convergence of dynamic routing under Lipschitz continuity assumptions.

Theorem 2.1.1 (Routing Convergence). Under the update rule above with coupling coefficients normalized via softmax, the routing procedure converges to a fixed point at a linear rate when the agreement function is contractive.

Proof Sketch. The routing algorithm defines a fixed-point iteration $c^{(t+1)} = T(c^{(t)})$ where $T$ is a contraction mapping under suitable conditions. The Banach fixed-point theorem guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point. ∎

2.1.2 Evolving Network Topologies

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) (Stanley & Miikkulainen, 2002) introduced genetic algorithms for evolving both network weights and architectures. NEAT addresses three key challenges:

1. Tracking genes through historical markings to enable crossover between different topologies.
2. Protecting structural innovation through speciation.
3. Starting from minimal initial structures and complexity.

HyperNEAT (Stanley et al., 2009) extended this to evolve generative encodings of connectivity patterns, enabling the evolution of large-scale networks with regular structure.

2.1.3 Modular Architectures and Mixture of Experts

Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Shazeer et al., 2017) scales model capacity by routing inputs to specialized sub-networks:

\mathbf{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{e}_i(\mathbf{x})

where $g_i(\mathbf{x})$ is a gating network output (typically softmax) and $\mathbf{e}_i(\mathbf{x})$ is the output of expert $i$. The gating network learns to assign inputs to the most appropriate experts, enabling conditional computation.

2.2 Causal and Archive-Based Learning

2.2.1 Causal Representation Learning

Schölkopf et al. (2021) formalized the problem of learning causal representations from observational data:

Definition 2.2.1 (Causal Representation Learning). Given observations $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ generated by latent variables $\mathbf{z} \in \mathcal{Z}$ with causal structure $\mathcal{G}$, learn:

· An encoder $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Z}$ that recovers latent variables
· A structural causal model (SCM) describing the generative process

The identifiability of such representations requires assumptions about the causal graph and intervention capabilities.

2.2.2 Temporal Dynamics Modeling

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) (Chen et al., 2018) model continuous-time dynamics:

\frac{d\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = f_\theta(\mathbf{h}(t), t)

The solution at time $T$ is obtained via numerical integration: $\mathbf{h}(T) = \mathbf{h}(0) + \int_0^T f_\theta(\mathbf{h}(t), t) dt$.

Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) (Tzen & Raginsky, 2019; Li et al., 2020) incorporate noise:

d\mathbf{h}_t = \mu_\theta(\mathbf{h}_t, t) dt + \sigma_\theta(\mathbf{h}_t, t) dW_t

The Fokker-Planck equation governs the evolution of the probability density $\rho(\mathbf{h}, t)$:

\partial_t \rho = -\nabla \cdot (\mu \rho) + \frac{1}{2} \nabla \nabla : (\sigma\sigma^\top \rho)

2.2.3 Memory-Augmented Networks

Differentiable Neural Computers (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) augment neural networks with external memory matrices that can be read from and written to via differentiable attention mechanisms. The memory $\mathbf{M}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times M}$ evolves as:

\mathbf{M}_t = \mathbf{M}_{t-1} \circ (\mathbf{1} - \mathbf{w}_t^w \mathbf{e}_t^\top) + \mathbf{w}_t^w \mathbf{v}_t^\top

where $\mathbf{w}_t^w$ is a write weighting, $\mathbf{e}_t$ is an erase vector, and $\mathbf{v}_t$ is a write vector.

2.3 Meta-Cognitive and Categorical AI

2.3.1 Classical Cognitive Architectures

ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought—Rational) (Anderson, 1983, 2007) models cognition through:

· Declarative memory: chunks with activation levels $A_i = B_i + \sum_j W_j S_{ji}$
· Procedural memory: production rules with utility $U_i = P_i G - C_i$
· Buffers: interfaces between modules

SOAR (State, Operator And Result) (Laird, 2012; Laird et al., 1987) emphasizes:

· Problem spaces as search in state spaces
· Operators as transformations between states
· Impasses triggering subgoaling and learning

2.3.2 Category Theory in Machine Learning

Definition 2.3.1 (Category). A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:

· A collection $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ of objects
· For each $A,B \in \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$, a set $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ of morphisms
· Composition $\circ: \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B,C) \times \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,C)$
· Identity morphisms $\text{id}_A \in \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,A)$

satisfying associativity and identity laws.

Definition 2.3.2 (Functor). A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ maps objects $A \mapsto F(A)$ and morphisms $f: A \to B$ to $F(f): F(A) \to F(B)$ preserving composition and identities.

Definition 2.3.3 (Adjunction). An adjunction $F \dashv G$ consists of functors $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, $G: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ with natural transformations:

· Unit $\eta: \text{id}_{\mathcal{C}} \Rightarrow G \circ F$
· Counit $\varepsilon: F \circ G \Rightarrow \text{id}_{\mathcal{D}}$

satisfying the triangle identities:

\varepsilon_{F(A)} \circ F(\eta_A) = \text{id}_{F(A)}


G(\varepsilon_B) \circ \eta_{G(B)} = \text{id}_{G(B)}

Fong et al. (2019) applied categorical methods to deep learning, showing that neural network architectures can be formalized as string diagrams in monoidal categories.

Definition 2.3.4 (Monad). A monad $(T, \eta, \mu)$ on a category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:

· An endofunctor $T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$
· A unit natural transformation $\eta: \text{id}_{\mathcal{C}} \Rightarrow T$
· A multiplication natural transformation $\mu: T^2 \Rightarrow T$

satisfying:

· $\mu \circ T\eta = \text{id}_T = \mu \circ \eta T$ (unit laws)
· $\mu \circ T\mu = \mu \circ \mu T$ (associativity)

Definition 2.3.5 (Sheaf). Let $(\mathcal{X}, J)$ be a site (category with Grothendieck topology). A presheaf $F: \mathcal{X}^{\text{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is a sheaf if for every covering family $\{U_i \to U\}$:

1. Locality: If $s,t \in F(U)$ have equal restrictions $s|_{U_i} = t|_{U_i}$ for all $i$, then $s = t$.
2. Gluing: Given compatible sections $s_i \in F(U_i)$ (i.e., $s_i|_{U_i \cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}$), there exists a unique $s \in F(U)$ with $s|_{U_i} = s_i$.

2.3.3 Neuro-Symbolic Integration

DeepProbLog (Manhaeve et al., 2018) integrates neural networks with probabilistic logic programming:

P(Q|\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\mathbf{y}} P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) \cdot [Q \text{ is true given } \mathbf{y}]

where $P(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ is provided by neural networks and the logical constraint is evaluated by a probabilistic logic engine.

2.4 Multi-Agent Coordination and Evolution

2.4.1 Game-Theoretic Foundations

Definition 2.4.1 (Cooperative Game). A cooperative game with transferable utility is a pair $(N, v)$ where $N = \{1,\dots,n\}$ is the set of players and $v: 2^N \to \mathbb{R}$ is a characteristic function with $v(\emptyset) = 0$.

Definition 2.4.2 (Shapley Value). The Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) attributes to player $i$:

\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(n-|S|-1)!}{n!} (v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S))

Theorem 2.4.1 (Shapley Uniqueness). The Shapley value is the unique attribution satisfying:

1. Efficiency: $\sum_{i \in N} \phi_i(v) = v(N)$
2. Symmetry: If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S \cup \{j\})$ for all $S \subseteq N \setminus \{i,j\}$, then $\phi_i(v) = \phi_j(v)$
3. Dummy player: If $v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S)$ for all $S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}$, then $\phi_i(v) = 0$
4. Additivity: $\phi(v + w) = \phi(v) + \phi(w)$

Definition 2.4.3 (Coalition Structure). A coalition structure is a partition $\mathcal{C} = \{C_1, \dots, C_m\}$ of $N$ into disjoint coalitions.

Definition 2.4.4 (Owen Value). For a game $(N,v)$ with coalition structure $\mathcal{C}$, the Owen value (Owen, 1977) for player $i \in C_k$ is:

\psi_i = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{S \subseteq \mathcal{C} \setminus \{C_k\}} \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{T \subseteq C_k \setminus \{i\}} \frac{v(Q_S \cup T \cup \{i\}) - v(Q_S \cup T)}{\binom{n_k-1}{|T|}}

where $Q_S = \bigcup_{C_j \in S} C_j$.

2.4.2 Evolutionary Dynamics

Definition 2.4.5 (Replicator Dynamics). In a population with $n$ types having frequencies $x_i$ and fitness $f_i(x)$, the replicator dynamics are:

\dot{x}_i = x_i(f_i(x) - \bar{f}(x))

where $\bar{f}(x) = \sum_j x_j f_j(x)$.

Definition 2.4.6 (Fokker-Planck Equation). For a stochastic process $dX_t = \mu(X_t)dt + \sigma(X_t)dW_t$, the probability density $\rho(x,t)$ evolves as:

\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}(\mu^i \rho) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}((\sigma\sigma^\top)^{ij} \rho)

2.5 Information Geometry and Statistical Manifolds

2.5.1 Fisher Information Metric

Definition 2.5.1 (Fisher Information Matrix). For a parametric family $p(x|\theta)$, the Fisher information matrix is:

g_{ij}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x|\theta)}\left[\frac{\partial \log p(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta^i} \frac{\partial \log p(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta^j}\right]

Theorem 2.5.1 (Chentsov's Uniqueness). The Fisher information metric is the unique Riemannian metric (up to scaling) on the simplex of probability distributions that is invariant under sufficient statistics.

Definition 2.5.2 (Natural Gradient). The natural gradient (Amari, 1998) is the steepest descent direction on the statistical manifold:

\tilde{\nabla} L(\theta) = G(\theta)^{-1} \nabla L(\theta)

Proposition 2.5.1 (Natural Gradient Properties). The natural gradient is invariant under reparameterization of the model and follows the geodesics of the Fisher metric in the limit of small step sizes.

Proof Sketch. Under a change of coordinates $\theta \mapsto \tilde{\theta}$, the Fisher metric transforms as $\tilde{g} = J^{-\top} g J^{-1}$, where $J$ is the Jacobian. The natural gradient transforms as $\tilde{\nabla} = J \tilde{\nabla}$, maintaining consistency. The geodesic property follows from the fact that natural gradient descent approximates the solution to $\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -G(\theta)^{-1}\nabla L(\theta)$. ∎

2.5.2 Geodesic Distance

Definition 2.5.3 (Geodesic Distance). For a Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g)$, the geodesic distance between points $p,q \in \mathcal{M}$ is:

d_g(p,q) = \inf_{\gamma(0)=p, \gamma(1)=q} \int_0^1 \sqrt{g_{\gamma(t)}(\dot{\gamma}(t), \dot{\gamma}(t))} dt

The geodesic equations are:

\ddot{\gamma}^k + \Gamma_{ij}^k \dot{\gamma}^i \dot{\gamma}^j = 0

where $\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection.

2.6 Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Maximum Caliber

2.6.1 Maximum Entropy Principle

Jaynes (1957) formulated statistical mechanics as inference: given constraints $\mathbb{E}[f_k] = \bar{f}_k$, the least biased distribution maximizes Shannon entropy:

p(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left(-\sum_k \lambda_k f_k(x)\right)

where $Z = \int \exp(-\sum_k \lambda_k f_k(x)) dx$ and Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_k$ enforce constraints.

2.6.2 Maximum Caliber Principle

Definition 2.6.1 (Path Entropy). For paths $\Gamma$ over time interval $[0,T]$, the path entropy is:

S[\rho] = -\int \mathcal{D}\Gamma \, \rho[\Gamma] \log \rho[\Gamma]

The Maximum Caliber principle (Jaynes, 1980; González & Davis, 2017) selects the path distribution maximizing $S[\rho]$ subject to constraints on path functionals $\mathbb{E}[g_m(\Gamma)] = \bar{g}_m$:

\rho[\Gamma] = \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} \exp\left(-\sum_m \gamma_m g_m(\Gamma)\right)

Theorem 2.6.1 (Jarzynski Equality). For a system driven from equilibrium state $A$ to $B$ with work $W[\Gamma]$ along path $\Gamma$:

\langle e^{-\beta W}\rangle = e^{-\beta \Delta F}

where $\Delta F = F_B - F_A$ is the free energy difference.

Proof Sketch (González & Davis, 2017). From the Maximum Caliber principle, the path distribution is $\rho[\Gamma] \propto e^{-\beta W[\Gamma]} \rho_A(\Gamma_0)$, where $\rho_A$ is the equilibrium distribution at initial state. Marginalizing over paths yields the result. ∎

2.6.3 Stochastic Thermodynamics

For a system described by state $x$ evolving via $dx = \mu(x)dt + \sigma(x)dW$, the entropy production rate satisfies:

\dot{S}_{\text{total}} = \int \rho(x,t) \left( \mu(x) - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial \log \rho}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx \geq 0

2.7 Stochastic Dynamics on Riemannian Manifolds

2.7.1 Brownian Motion on Manifolds

Definition 2.7.1 (Laplace-Beltrami Operator). On a Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g)$, the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on functions $f$ is:

\Delta_{\text{LB}} f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det g}} \partial_i \left( \sqrt{\det g} \, g^{ij} \partial_j f \right)

Definition 2.7.2 (Brownian Motion). Brownian motion on $\mathcal{M}$ is a diffusion process with generator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{\text{LB}}$.

2.7.2 Covariant Langevin Equation

Diósi (2024) derived the covariant form of the Langevin equation on Riemannian manifolds:

dx^a = e^a_A \circ dW^A + V^a dt

where $\circ$ denotes Stratonovich integration, $e^a_A$ is a vielbein satisfying $e^a_A e^b_B \delta^{AB} = g^{ab}$, and the covariant constraint requires $\nabla_a e^a_A = 0$.

Theorem 2.7.1 (Covariant Fokker-Planck Equation). The probability density $\rho$ on $\mathcal{M}$ evolves as:

\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\nabla_a(\rho V^a) + \frac{1}{2} \Delta_{\text{LB}} \rho

Proof Sketch. This follows from the covariant Langevin equation using Itô's lemma and the Stratonovich-to-Itô conversion, accounting for the Riemannian curvature through the Laplace-Beltrami operator. ∎
