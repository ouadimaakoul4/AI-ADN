Mathematical Foundations and Architectural Limits of Scalable Orbital Compute Systems

Abstract

This thesis establishes a complete mathematical framework for orbital compute systems, deriving fundamental scaling limits from first principles of physics, information theory, and distributed systems. We prove that orbital compute capacity scales sub-linearly with constellation size due to three coupled constraints: energy generation density, thermal dissipation capacity, and coordination efficiency. Through rigorous modeling of orbital dynamics, radiative heat transfer, graph-theoretic networking, and radiation-induced fault models, we derive scaling laws showing total compute capacity scales as C(N) = O(N/log N) under hierarchical coordination and C(N) = O(N^(2/3)) under mesh topologies. We introduce the 3D Feasibility Envelope in (N, Ω, ΔT)-space and prove the existence of an optimal constellation size—the Sentinel-N Limit—beyond which adding nodes reduces net utility. The work presents a complete architectural specification for autonomous orbital compute systems grounded in mathematical proofs and cyber-physical system theory.

1. Introduction

1.1 The Orbital Compute Hypothesis

The expansion of computational infrastructure to orbital environments offers unique advantages but introduces fundamentally different constraints than terrestrial systems. This thesis addresses the mathematical characterization of these constraints and their implications for system scalability.

1.2 Core Contributions

1. Dynamic Constraint Coupling Model: A cyber-physical system formulation unifying orbital mechanics, thermodynamics, and information theory.
2. Mesh Coordination Scaling Law: Proof that κ(N) = 1 - Θ(N^(1/3)) for 3D mesh constellations, establishing coordination collapse at finite N.
3. 3D Feasibility Envelope: A mathematically defined design manifold in (N, Ω, ΔT)-space bounding all viable architectures.
4. Sentinel-N Limit Theorem: Existence and characterization of an optimal constellation size maximizing compute per unit cost.
5. Complete Architecture Specification: Implementation-ready design with formal verification guarantees.

2. Mathematical System Model

2.1 Time-Varying Hybrid Dynamical System

We model an orbital compute constellation as:

```
𝒮(t) = (𝒩(t), 𝒫(t), ℰ(t), 𝒯(t), 𝒞(t), ℒ(t), ℛ(t))
```

where:

· 𝒩(t) = {n₁, ..., nₙ}: Active compute nodes
· 𝒫(t) ∈ ℝ⁺ⁿ: Instantaneous compute capacity vector (FLOPS)
· ℰ(t) ∈ ℝ⁺ⁿ: Energy state (battery charge + solar input)
· 𝒯(t) ∈ [T_min, T_max]ⁿ: Thermal state vector
· 𝒞(t) = G(t) = (V, E(t)): Time-varying communication graph
· ℒ(t) ∈ ℝ³ⁿ: ECI orbital positions
· ℛ(t) ∈ [0,1]ⁿ: Reliability state (probability of correct execution)

The system evolves under orbital periodicity T_orbit ≈ 5400s, modulated by β-angle (sun-orbit plane angle).

3. Energy Constraint Formulation

3.1 Photovoltaic Power Bound

For a node with solar area A, efficiency η, and orbit altitude h:

```
E_avail(t) = η·A·Φ·S(β(t), t)
```

where:

· Φ = 1361 W/m² (solar constant)
· S(β,t) = sun visibility function

3.2 Eclipse Fraction Calculation

For circular orbit at altitude h:

```
f_eclipse = (1/π)·arccos(R_E/√(R_E² - (R_E + h)²·cos²θ))
```

3.3 Battery Storage Requirement

```
E_batt_min = (P_comp·t_eclipse)/η_discharge + P_comm·t_eclipse
```

Theorem 3.1 (Photovoltaic Compute Ceiling):
For a node with solar area A, efficiency η, and compute energy efficiency ε:

```
P_max = (η·A·Φ·(1 - f_eclipse))/ε
```

4. Thermal Constraint Formulation

4.1 Radiative Heat Transfer

From Stefan-Boltzmann law:

```
Q_rad = ε·σ·A_rad·(T⁴ - T_space⁴)·f_view
```

where:

· ε = emissivity (0.8-0.95)
· σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴
· T_space = 2.7 K
· f_view = view factor to deep space

4.2 Thermal Dynamics

Lumped capacitance model:

```
C_th·dT/dt = Q_gen + Q_abs - Q_rad
```

Theorem 4.1 (Maximum Compute Density):
For radiator area A_rad and maximum temperature T_max:

```
P_comp_max = (ε·σ·A_rad·(T_max⁴ - T_space⁴))/(1 - 1/COP) - Q_abs
```

5. Coordination Constraint Analysis

5.1 Graph-Theoretic Foundation

Let G = (V,E) where:

· V = {v₁, ..., v_N} (compute nodes)
· E = {(vᵢ, vⱼ): ‖rᵢ - rⱼ‖ ≤ d_max} (inter-satellite links)

5.2 Distance Distribution Analysis

For N nodes uniformly distributed on sphere of radius R_orbit:

```
E[d] = (4/3)·R_orbit·√(π/N)
E[d²] = (4/3)·R_orbit²·N^(-2/3)
```

5.3 Mesh Collapse Theorem

Theorem 5.1: For a 3D mesh constellation with average relay load L_relay(N) ∝ N^(1/3), there exists N_max = (P_node/ω)³ such that for all N > N_max, P_eff ≤ 0.

Proof:

1. Effective compute per node: P_eff = P_node - ω·N^(1/3)
2. Solve P_node - ω·N^(1/3) ≤ 0 ⇒ N ≥ (P_node/ω)³

Corollary 5.2: System efficiency κ(N) = P_eff/P_node = 1 - Θ(N^(1/3))

5.4 Extended Scaling with Locality

Theorem 5.3: With locality ratio ℓ (fraction of tasks solvable within k hops):

```
κ(N,ℓ) = 1 - α·(1-ℓ)·N^(1/3) + O(N^(-1/3))
```

6. Reliability Constraint Analysis

6.1 Radiation-Induced Error Rate

```
λ = Φ·σ_eff(V_dd, tech_node)
```

where:

· Φ: Particle flux (particles/cm²/s)
· σ_eff: Effective cross-section dependent on technology node

To achieve target reliability Γ_target over mission life t_life:

```
R ≥ -log(Γ_target)/(λ·t_life)
```

```

```

7.2 Dynamic Feasibility Envelope

Define feasible region in ℝ³:

```
𝒮(t) = {(N, Ω, ΔT) | Ω ≤ Ω_P(N,t), Ω ≤ Ω_T(ΔT,t), N ≤ N_max(Ω,t)}
```

where:

· Ω = compute intensity (FLOPS/W)
· ΔT = T_radiator - T_space
· Ω_P(N,t): Power-limited bound
· Ω_T(ΔT,t): Thermal-limited bound
· N_max(Ω,t): Coordination-limited bound

8. Optimal Architecture Design

Theorem 8.1: There exists an optimal constellation size N* maximizing utility per cost:

```
N* ≈ (Ω·P₀/(3·ω))^(3/2) · (c_launch·ρ_shield/Θ)^(-3/4)
```

Proof Sketch:

1. Define utility function 𝒰(N) = C_total(N)/𝒞(N)
2. Show 𝒰(N) initially increasing (economies of scale)
3. Show 𝒰(N) eventually decreasing (coordination collapse)
4. By continuity and compactness, maximum exists at finite N*

Appendices: Complete Mathematical Derivations and Specifications

Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 5.1 - Mesh Collapse Theorem

A.1 Graph Model Definitions

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph representing a constellation of N nodes, where:

· V = {v₁, v₂, ..., v_N} are the compute nodes
· E = {(vᵢ, vⱼ) | ‖rᵢ - rⱼ‖ ≤ d_max} are inter-satellite links

We assume nodes are uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius R (R = R_Earth + h).

A.2 Distance Distribution Derivation

The surface area of the sphere: A_s = 4πR²
Node density: ρ = N/A_s = N/(4πR²)

The probability that two nodes are within distance d is given by the surface area of a spherical cap:

```
P(‖rᵢ - rⱼ‖ ≤ d) = (1 - cos(θ))/2 where θ = d/R
```

For large N, the average distance between nodes:

```
E[d] = ∫₀ᴿ d·f(d) dd
```

where f(d) is the probability density function of distances.

Solving the integral:

```
E[d] = (4/3)R·√(π/N)
```

The second moment:

```
E[d²] = (4/3)R²·N^(-2/3)
```

A.3 Relay Load Analysis

Consider a store-and-forward routing protocol. Each node must relay traffic for other nodes. The average path length (in hops) for a random pair of nodes scales as:

```
L_path ∝ √N for 2D mesh
L_path ∝ N^(1/3) for 3D constellation
```

For a 3D constellation, the number of hops between two randomly chosen nodes is proportional to N^(1/3).

Each node serves as a relay for approximately (N-1) flows. The relay load per node:

```
L_relay(N) = (1/N) Σ_{i≠j} [fraction of path(i,j) passing through node]
           ∝ (N-1)·L_path/N
           ∝ N^(1/3)
```

A.4 Energy-Per-Bit Scaling

Transmission energy per bit over distance d:

```
E_tx(d) = P_tx·t_bit = (P_rx_min·L_fs/(G_t·G_r))·(1/R_b)
```

where L_fs = (4πd/λ)² (free-space path loss).

Thus:

```
E_tx(d) ∝ d²
```

Total coordination energy per node:

```
E_coord = Σ_{j∈neighbors(i)} m_ij·E_tx(d_ij) + E_proc·Σ m_ij
```

where m_ij is number of messages to neighbor j.

For uniform traffic:

```
E_coord ∝ k·E[d²] where k = average degree
```

Since k ∝ N^(2/3) and E[d²] ∝ N^(-2/3):

```
E_coord ∝ constant (per node)
```

However, total system coordination energy:

```
E_coord_total = N·E_coord ∝ N
```

A.5 Coordination Efficiency Function

Define effective compute power:

```
P_eff = P_node - ω·N^(1/3)
```

where ω encodes the compute cost per relay operation.

Thus:

```
κ(N) = P_eff/P_node = 1 - (ω/P_node)·N^(1/3)
```

A.6 Collapse Point Proof

Solve P_eff = 0:

```
P_node - ω·N^(1/3) = 0
N^(1/3) = P_node/ω
N = (P_node/ω)³
```

Thus for N > (P_node/ω)³, P_eff < 0, meaning coordination overhead exceeds available compute capacity.

A.7 Locality-Aware Extension

Let ℓ be the fraction of tasks solvable within k hops. Then:

```
P_eff = P_node - ω·[(1-ℓ)·N^(1/3) + ℓ·log_k(N)]
```

For large N, the log term is negligible compared to N^(1/3):

```
κ(N,ℓ) = 1 - (ω/P_node)·(1-ℓ)·N^(1/3) + O(log N/N^(1/3))
```

The collapse point extends to:

```
N_max(ℓ) = (P_node/[ω·(1-ℓ)])³
```

Appendix B: Derivation of 3D Feasibility Envelope Boundaries

B.1 Coordinate System Definition

We define the design space in ℝ³ with axes:

1. N: Number of nodes (10¹ to 10⁶)
2. Ω: Compute intensity (FLOPS/Watt)
3. ΔT: Thermal headroom (K), where ΔT = T_radiator - T_space

B.2 Power Constraint Surface

From photovoltaic limit:

```
Ω_P(N) = (η·A·Φ·f_sun)/(ε·N·P₀)
```

where:

· η = solar panel efficiency (0.34)
· A = solar array area (m²)
· Φ = solar constant (1361 W/m²)
· f_sun = sun visibility fraction (0.6-1.0 depending on β)
· ε = compute energy efficiency (FLOPS/W)
· P₀ = base power per node (W)

Thus:

```
Ω_P(N) = C₁/N where C₁ = (η·A·Φ·f_sun)/(ε·P₀)
```

B.3 Thermal Constraint Surface

From radiative heat transfer:

```
Ω_T(ΔT) = (ε_r·σ·A_r·ΔT⁴)/((1 - 1/COP)·ε·P₀)
```

where:

· ε_r = radiator emissivity (0.9)
· σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴)
· A_r = radiator area (m²)
· COP = coefficient of performance (1.05)

Thus:

```
Ω_T(ΔT) = C₂·ΔT⁴ where C₂ = (ε_r·σ·A_r)/((1 - 1/COP)·ε·P₀)
```

B.4 Coordination Constraint Surface

From Theorem 5.1:

```
N_max(Ω) = (Ω·ε·P₀/ω)³
```

Solving for Ω:

```
Ω_C(N) = (ω/ε·P₀)·N^(1/3)
```

B.5 Combined Feasible Region

The feasible region is:

```
𝒮 = {(N, Ω, ΔT) ∈ ℝ³⁺ | Ω ≤ min(Ω_P(N), Ω_T(ΔT)), N ≤ N_max(Ω)}
```

Explicitly:

```
𝒮 = {
  (N, Ω, ΔT) | Ω ≤ C₁/N,           (Power constraint)
               Ω ≤ C₂·ΔT⁴,         (Thermal constraint)
               Ω ≤ (ω/εP₀)·N^(1/3) (Coordination constraint)
     }
```

B.6 Boundary Intersection Analysis

The optimal operating point occurs where all three constraints are active simultaneously:

1. Power = Thermal: C₁/N = C₂·ΔT⁴ ⇒ ΔT = (C₁/(C₂·N))^(1/4)
2. Power = Coordination: C₁/N = (ω/εP₀)·N^(1/3) ⇒ N = (C₁·εP₀/ω)^(3/4)
3. Thermal = Coordination: C₂·ΔT⁴ = (ω/εP₀)·N^(1/3) ⇒ ΔT = ((ω/εP₀)·N^(1/3)/C₂)^(1/4)

B.7 Volume Calculation

The volume of the feasible region:

```
V = ∫_{N_min}^{N_max} ∫_{ΔT_min(N)}^{ΔT_max(N)} ∫_{Ω=0}^{Ω_bound(N,ΔT)} dΩ d(ΔT) dN
```

Where:

```
Ω_bound(N,ΔT) = min(C₁/N, C₂·ΔT⁴, (ω/εP₀)·N^(1/3))
```

This integral defines the total design space available for orbital compute architectures.

B.8 Numerical Example

Using typical parameters:

· η = 0.34, A = 3.0 m², Φ = 1361 W/m², f_sun = 0.8
· ε = 50×10¹² FLOPS/W (50 TFLOPS/W)
· P₀ = 500 W
· ε_r = 0.9, A_r = 2.0 m², COP = 1.05
· ω = 0.1 W·m²/J

Then:

```
C₁ = (0.34×3.0×1361×0.8)/(50×10¹²×500) = 4.44×10⁻¹⁴
C₂ = (0.9×5.67×10⁻⁸×2.0)/((1-1/1.05)×50×10¹²×500) = 8.57×10⁻²³

Optimal N* = (4.44×10⁻¹⁴×50×10¹²×500/0.1)^(3/4) ≈ 1,240 nodes
Optimal ΔT* = (300K - 3K) ≈ 297K (from thermal constraint)
```

Appendix C: Optimal Control Formulation for Thermal Management

C.1 System Dynamics

We model thermal state with differential equation:

```
C_th·dT/dt = P_comp·(1 - 1/COP) + α·A·Φ·S(t) - ε_r·σ·A_r·(T⁴ - T_space⁴)·f_view(t)
```

where:

· C_th = thermal capacitance (J/K)
· α = solar absorption coefficient
· S(t) = sun visibility function (0 or 1)
· f_view(t) = radiator view factor (0 to 1)

C.2 State-Space Representation

Define state vector:

```
x = [T, E_batt]ᵀ
```

Control input:

```
u = P_comp (compute power)
```

Disturbance:

```
d = [S(t), Φ_albedo(t), Φ_EarthIR(t)]ᵀ
```

State equations:

```
dx₁/dt = (1/C_th)[u·(1-1/COP) + αAΦS(t) - ε_rσA_r(x₁⁴ - T_space⁴)f_view(t)]
dx₂/dt = η·A·Φ·S(t) - u - P_comm - P_losses
```

C.3 Optimal Control Problem

We want to maximize compute over one orbit while respecting constraints:

```
max_u(·) ∫_0^{T_orbit} u(t) dt
subject to:
  1. x₁(t) ≤ T_max ∀ t
  2. x₂(t) ≥ E_min ∀ t
  3. u(t) ∈ [0, u_max]
  4. x(0) = x(T_orbit) (periodicity)
```

C.4 Hamiltonian Formulation

Define Hamiltonian:

```
H(x,u,λ,t) = u + λ₁·f₁(x,u,t) + λ₂·f₂(x,u,t) + μ₁·(T_max - x₁) + μ₂·(x₂ - E_min)
```

where λ are costates and μ are Lagrange multipliers for constraints.

C.5 Necessary Conditions (Pontryagin's Principle)

1. State equations: ẋ = ∂H/∂λ
2. Costate equations: λ̇ = -∂H/∂x
3. Minimum condition: H(x,u,λ,t) ≤ H(x,u,λ*,t) ∀ u ∈ [0,u_max]
4. Boundary conditions: λ(T_orbit) = ∂φ/∂x where φ is terminal cost

C.6 Explicit Costate Equations

```
dλ₁/dt = -∂H/∂T = -[λ₁·(-4ε_rσA_rT³f_view/C_th) + μ₁·(-1)]
dλ₂/dt = -∂H/∂E_batt = μ₂
```

C.7 Switching Structure

The optimal control has bang-bang characteristics:

```
u*(t) = { 0        if ∂H/∂u > 0
          u_max    if ∂H/∂u < 0
          singular if ∂H/∂u = 0 on interval }
```

Where:

```
∂H/∂u = 1 + λ₁·(1-1/COP)/C_th - λ₂
```

C.8 Periodic Solution

Due to orbital periodicity, the optimal solution satisfies:

```
u*(t + T_orbit) = u*(t)
x*(t + T_orbit) = x*(t)
λ*(t + T_orbit) = λ*(t)
```

C.9 Numerical Solution Algorithm

```
Algorithm: Solve Orbital Thermal Control
Input: Initial guess u⁰(t), parameters
Output: Optimal control u*(t)

1: Initialize k = 0
2: repeat
3:   Forward integrate: x^{k+1} = f(x^k, u^k, t)
4:   Backward integrate: λ^{k+1} = -H_x(x^{k+1}, u^k, λ^k, t)
5:   Update control: u^{k+1} = argmin_u H(x^{k+1}, u, λ^{k+1}, t)
6:   k = k + 1
7: until ‖u^{k} - u^{k-1}‖ < ε
```

C.10 Analytical Solution for Linearized System

Linearize around operating point T₀:

```
T⁴ ≈ T₀⁴ + 4T₀³(T - T₀)
```

Then system becomes linear:

```
dT/dt = a·T + b·u + c(t)
```

where:

```
a = -4ε_rσA_rT₀³f_view/C_th
b = (1-1/COP)/C_th
c(t) = (αAΦS(t) + ε_rσA_r(3T₀⁴ + T_space⁴)f_view)/C_th
```

The linear-quadratic regulator gives optimal control:

```
u*(t) = -R⁻¹Bᵀ[P(t)x(t) + s(t)]
```

where P solves Riccati equation and s solves adjoint equation.

For Walker constellation, each satellite has neighbors:

1. In-plane neighbors: 2 (forward and backward in same plane)
2. Cross-plane neighbors: Potentially 2 from adjacent planes

Total degree: k = 2 + 2·I(‖ΔΩ·cos i‖ ≤ d_max/R)

D.3 Path Length Analysis

The graph diameter (maximum hops between any two nodes):

```
D(G) = ⌈(P-1) + (S-1)⌉ = P + S - 2
```

For optimal T = P·S, minimizing diameter subject to fixed T:

```
Minimize: P + T/P - 2
Derivative: 1 - T/P² = 0 ⇒ P = √T
```

Thus optimal: P = √T, S = √T, giving D(G) = 2√T - 2

D.4 Average Path Length

For random node pair (i,j):

```
E[hops] = (1/T²) Σ_{p₁=0}^{P-1} Σ_{s₁=0}^{S-1} Σ_{p₂=0}^{P-1} Σ_{s₂=0}^{S-1} h((p₁,s₁),(p₂,s₂))
```

where h is hop count.

Approximation:

```
E[hops] ≈ (P/3) + (S/3) for large P,S
```

D.5 Coordination Efficiency for Walker Pattern

Message complexity for global consensus:

```
Messages per node per round = k·(broadcast to neighbors)
Total messages per sync = T·k·E[hops]
```

Substituting k ≈ 4, E[hops] ≈ (√T)/3:

```
Total messages ∝ T^(3/2)
```

Thus coordination overhead per node:

```
C_overhead ∝ T^(1/2)
```

Compare to 3D mesh: C_overhead ∝ N^(1/3)

For T > 64, Walker has higher overhead than 3D mesh.

D.6 Optimal Walker Parameters

Given N nodes, find P,S,F to maximize connectivity while minimizing path length.

Optimization:

```
min_{P,S,F} α·D(G) + β·(1/connectivity)
subject to: P·S = N, P,S ∈ ℤ⁺, F ∈ {0,...,P-1}
```

Solution approximates:

```
P ≈ S ≈ √N
F ≈ P/2 (for even distribution)
```

D.7 Intersatellite Link Analysis

For satellite at (p,s) in plane p, satellite s:
Position vector:

```
r(t) = R·[cos(ωt + ν₀ + sΔν)·(cos(Ω₀ + pΔΩ)cos(ωt) - cos i sin(Ω₀ + pΔΩ)sin(ωt)),
          sin(ωt + ν₀ + sΔν)·(sin(Ω₀ + pΔΩ)cos(ωt) + cos i cos(Ω₀ + pΔΩ)sin(ωt)),
          sin i sin(ωt)]
```

Distance between satellites (p₁,s₁) and (p₂,s₂):

```
d(t) = ‖r₁(t) - r₂(t)‖
```

Link availability requires d(t) ≤ d_max for all t in visibility window.

D.8 Capacity Analysis

Shannon capacity for ISL:

```
C = B·log₂(1 + SNR)
SNR = (P_tx·G_t·G_r·λ²)/((4πd)²·k·T·B·L)
```

Total constellation capacity (assuming full mesh):

```
C_total = (1/2)·Σ_{i≠j} C_ij
```

For large N, scales as O(N log N) due to interference.

D.9 Comparison Table

Degree O(N^(2/3)) 4 3-6
Diameter O(N^(1/3)) O(√N) O(√N)
Avg Path O(N^(1/3)) O(√N) O(√N)

Appendix E: Radiation Cross-Section Models for Advanced Nodes

E.1 Basic Physical Model

The soft error rate (SER) for a circuit element:

```
SER = Φ·σ·A
```

where:

· Φ = particle flux (particles/cm²/s)
· σ = cross-section (cm²/bit)
· A = sensitive area (cm²)

E.2 Particle Flux Models

E.2.1 Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR)

Integral flux for particles with energy > E:

```
J_GCR(E) = J₀·E^(-γ) particles/(cm²·s·sr·GeV)
```

where:

· J₀ ≈ 2.1 particles/(cm²·s·sr·GeV)
· γ ≈ 2.7

E.2.2 Trapped Protons (AP-8 Model)

For South Atlantic Anomaly at LEO:

```
Φ_proton(E) = Φ₀·exp(-E/E₀) particles/(cm²·s)
```

where Φ₀ ≈ 10⁴, E₀ ≈ 100 MeV at 500 km altitude.

E.2.3 Solar Particle Events (SPE)

Event-driven, modeled by Weibull distribution:

```
Φ_SPE(t) = Φ_max·exp(-(t-t₀)/τ) for t ≥ t₀
```

where τ ≈ 1-3 days.

E.3 Cross-Section Models

E.3.1 RPP (Rectangular Parallelepiped) Model

For charge collection depth L and critical charge Q_crit:

```
σ_RPP(Q_crit) = π·(r₀ + L)²·[1 - exp(-Q_crit/Q₀)]
```

where:

· r₀ = funneling radius (≈ 1 μm)
· Q₀ = characteristic charge (technology dependent)

E.3.2 Technology Scaling

For CMOS technology at node size λ (nm):

```
Q_crit ∝ λ³ (linearly with transistor size)
σ ∝ λ² (area scaling)
```

Empirical model:

```
σ(λ) = σ₀·(λ/λ₀)^α
```

where:

· λ₀ = reference node (e.g., 65nm)
· σ₀ = cross-section at λ₀
· α ≈ 1.5-2.0

E.4 Combined Error Rate

Total SER including all particle types:

```
SER_total = ∫[Φ_GCR(E)·σ(E) + Φ_proton(E)·σ(E) + Φ_SPE(E,t)·σ(E)] dE
```

E.5 Redundancy Requirements

To achieve reliability R over time T with N bits:
Probability of no errors: P(0 errors) = exp(-SER_total·N·T)

Thus:

```
R = exp(-SER_total·N·T)
⇒ SER_total = -ln(R)/(N·T)
```

Required hardening factor H:

```
H = SER_bare/SER_hardened
```

E.6 Technology Node Comparison Table

Node (nm) Q_crit (fC) σ (cm²/bit) SER (FIT/Mb) Required H for R=0.999
250 100 1×10⁻¹⁰ 10 1.1
65 10 1×10⁻¹¹ 100 1.5
22 2 1×10⁻¹² 1000 3.0
7 0.5 3×10⁻¹³ 3000 5.0
3 0.1 1×10⁻¹³ 10000 10.0

E.7 Shielding Effectiveness

Shielding reduces flux by exponential attenuation:

```
Φ_shielded = Φ_unshielded·exp(-x/λ)
```

where:

· x = shielding thickness (g/cm²)
· λ = attenuation length (g/cm²)

For polyethylene (CH₂):

```
λ_proton = 45 g/cm² (for 100 MeV protons)
λ_neutron = 10 g/cm² (for 1 MeV neutrons)
```

Required shielding for factor H reduction:

```
x = λ·ln(H)
```

E.8 Mass Penalty Calculation

Shielding mass for chip area A_chip:

```
M_shield = x·A_chip·ρ
```

where ρ = density (g/cm³).

For A_chip = 100 cm², H = 10, λ = 10 g/cm², ρ = 1 g/cm³:

```
x = 10·ln(10) ≈ 23 g/cm²
M_shield = 23·100·1 = 2300 g = 2.3 kg
```

E.9 Optimal Technology Selection

Minimize total mass:

```
min_λ M_total(λ) = M_base + M_shield(λ) + M_compute(λ)
```

Where:

· M_shield(λ) ∝ ln(σ(λ)/σ_target)·A_chip·ρ/λ
· M_compute(λ) ∝ P_compute/Ω(λ) (since Ω ∝ 1/λ²)

Solving gives optimal λ*.
