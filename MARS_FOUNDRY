4.2 Thermal Balance During Martian Night

```
Night Conditions (-100°C, no solar):
Furnace heat loss: Q_loss = hAΔT + εσA(T⁴-T_env⁴)
├── h = 5 W/m²·K (convective, negligible at 0.6 kPa)
├── A = 2.5 m² (furnace surface)
├── ε = 0.1 (polished foil exterior)
├── T = 1500°C (1773 K during operation)
├── T_env = 173 K (-100°C)
└── Q_loss = 0 + 0.1×5.67e-8×2.5×(1773⁴-173⁴) ≈ 7.4 kW

Conclusion: Cannot maintain 1500°C through night without
excessive battery use → Schedule smelting for daylight hours only

3. Tertiary: Regolith insulation mound around furnace
4. Recovery: Reheat from 500°C (saves 60% energy vs cold start)

Slag Solidification in Crucible (JAM-RECOVERY):
1. Identification: Thermal imaging shows uneven cooling
2. Procedure: Induction heating of crucible exterior to 1150°C
3. Extraction: Tilt + vibration to break slag bond
4. Prevention: Next batch includes flux (CaO) to lower slag viscosity
