Executive Summary

LumiaForge is an open-source initiative developing the next generation of adaptive display technology. By combining computational holography with real-time machine learning, the system enables lensless, distortion-free projections that dynamically conform to any surface geometry, texture, or ambient lighting condition. This white paper details the complete technical architecture, prototype roadmap, and vision for creating truly ambient, intelligent displays.

1. Introduction: The Ambient Display Paradigm

Traditional projection systems are fundamentally constrained by geometry: they require flat surfaces, careful alignment, and controlled lighting. The LumiaForge vision reimagines the display as an intelligent light sculptor rather than a passive projector.

1.1 Core Innovation

LumiaForge implements a closed-loop system where:

1. Perception: A 3D sensor maps the target surface's geometry and texture
2. Computation: A neural network calculates the optimal holographic pattern
3. Modulation: A spatial light modulator (SLM) shapes light at the wavefront level
4. Adaptation: Continuous feedback refines the projection in real-time

This approach enables lensless projection onto non-planar surfaces (curved walls, textured finishes) while maintaining image fidelity.

1.2 Differentiators from Existing Technologies

Technology Limitation LumiaForge Solution
Traditional Projectors Requires flat surfaces; keystone correction limited Adaptive to 3D geometry via wavefront shaping
Laser Projectors Still requires lenses; fixed focus Lensless propagation; computational refocusing
Holographic Displays Often fixed content or simple patterns Dynamic, real-time CGH with surface adaptation
Projection Mapping Software-only warping; loses resolution Physical wavefront correction preserves quality
