**The Geometric Certification of Intelligence:

A Mathematical Framework for AI Safety and Reliability**

Abstract

We present a unified mathematical framework for certifying artificial intelligence systems through geometric and statistical signatures of their learned representations. Drawing on functional topology, nonparametric statistics, and temporal embedding theory, we introduce a rigorous foundation for evaluating AI safety that transcends conventional performance metrics. We demonstrate that deterministic physical processes generate compact perceptual manifolds with finite Hausdorff radii, that these manifolds can be validated via quantile discrepancy measures with finite-sample guarantees, and that their temporal evolution can be monitored through hypothesis testing in embedding spaces. Collectively, these advances enable the creation of "manifold passports" — mathematically certified characterizations of AI systems' reliability, stability, and domain of competence.

1. Introduction: The Need for Geometric Intelligence Certification

Current AI evaluation relies overwhelmingly on aggregate performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, perplexity) computed over finite test sets. While useful, these metrics provide incomplete safety assurances: they offer limited guarantees about worst-case behavior, fail to characterize what models have actually learned, and provide no early warnings when models operate outside their domain of competence.

We propose a paradigm shift from extrinsic evaluation (how systems perform on tasks) to intrinsic certification (what geometric structures they have learned and how reliably they approximate them). This white paper synthesizes three mathematical advances into a unified certification framework:

1. Deterministic Functional Topology (Di Santi, 2025): Real-world phenomena generate signals that concentrate on compact subsets of Banach spaces, with finite Hausdorff radii and stable invariants.
2. Quantile Curve Estimation (Iyengar et al., 2025): Black-box simulators can be validated via the complete quantile function of their discrepancy from ground truth, with finite-sample statistical guarantees.
3. Temporal Perspective Space Theory (Bridgeford & Helm, 2025): Multi-agent system dynamics can be monitored through hypothesis testing in low-dimensional embedding spaces that preserve temporal relationships.

Together, these provide the mathematical foundation for geometric AI certification.

2. Mathematical Foundations

2.1 Compact Perceptual Manifolds (Di Santi)

Let a physical system produce outputs through a deterministic mapping:

x = f(s, \theta), \quad s \in \mathcal{S}, \ \theta \in \Theta

where x(t) \in C^0([0,T]) with supremum norm \|x\|_\infty = \sup_{t\in[0,T]}|x(t)|. The perceptual set generated by the system is:

\mathcal{M} = \{f(s,\theta) : s \in \mathcal{S}, \theta \in \Theta\} \subset C^0([0,T])

Theorem 2.1 (Compactness): If \{f(s,\theta)\} is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on [0,T], then \mathcal{M} is compact in C^0([0,T]).

Proof: Direct application of Arzelà-Ascoli theorem. □

Compactness implies existence of a center x_0 \in \mathcal{M} and finite perceptual radius:

r = \sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}} \|x - x_0\|_\infty < \infty

The perceptual radius r represents the intrinsic variability of the phenomenon. For empirical estimation, given samples \{x_i\}_{i=1}^n, define:

\hat{r}_n = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \|x_i - x_0\|_\infty

Theorem 2.2 (Convergence): If sampling becomes dense in \mathcal{S} \times \Theta, then \hat{r}_n \to r almost surely.

This finite radius provides the first certification parameter: the extent of known variability.

2.2 Universal Approximation of Perceptual Functions

Let \Phi : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} be a continuous perceptual functional (e.g., a classifier). By compactness of \mathcal{M} and continuity of \Phi:

Theorem 2.3 (Uniform Continuity): \Phi is uniformly continuous on \mathcal{M}.

Theorem 2.4 (Universal Approximation): For every \epsilon > 0, there exists a neural network N_\epsilon satisfying:

\sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}} |\Phi(x) - N_\epsilon(x)| < \epsilon

Proof: Compactness of \mathcal{M} enables application of the Universal Approximation Theorem (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991). □

This explains why neural networks can learn perceptual categories: the geometry enables approximation.

2.3 Quantile Discrepancy Certification (Iyengar et al.)

Consider a black-box simulator producing outputs Y_{\text{sim}} \sim Q_{\text{sim}}(\cdot|z_{\text{sim}},\psi,r) and ground truth Y_{\text{gt}} \sim Q_{\text{gt}}(\cdot|z,\psi). For a scenario \psi \sim \Psi, define population parameters:

p_\psi = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim Q_{\text{gt}}}[y], \quad q_\psi = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{P}_{\text{sim}}}[\Pi_{\text{sim}}(\psi,z)]

Given finite samples, we observe estimators \hat{p}_\psi and \hat{q}_\psi. The discrepancy for a loss function L: \Theta \times \Theta \to [0,\infty) is:

\Delta_\psi = L(p_\psi, \hat{q}_\psi)

Let F_\Delta be the CDF of \Delta_\psi when \psi \sim \Psi, with quantile function:

V(\alpha) = \inf\{t \in \mathbb{R} : F_\Delta(t) \geq \alpha\}, \quad \alpha \in [0,1]

We construct a calibrated estimate \hat{V}_m(\cdot, \mathcal{D}) from m scenarios.

Methodology: For each scenario j, compute confidence set \mathcal{C}_j(\hat{p}_j) satisfying \mathbb{P}(p_j \in \mathcal{C}_j(\hat{p}_j)) \geq \gamma, then compute pseudo-discrepancy:

\hat{\Delta}_j = \sup_{u \in \mathcal{C}_j(\hat{p}_j)} L(u, \hat{q}_j)

Define \hat{V}_m(\alpha) as the empirical \alpha-quantile of \{\hat{\Delta}_j\}_{j=1}^m.

Theorem 2.5 (Quantile Coverage): Under assumptions of independent data and regular discrepancy, for any \alpha \in (0,1), with probability at least 1-\eta over calibration data \mathcal{D}:

\mathbb{P}_{\psi \sim \Psi}(\Delta_\psi \leq \hat{V}_m(1-\tfrac{\alpha}{2})|\mathcal{D}) \geq 1-\alpha - \frac{\varepsilon(\alpha,m,\eta)}{m}

where \varepsilon(\alpha,m,\eta) = O(\log m) vanishes as m \to \infty.

This provides finite-sample guarantees for worst-case behavior.

2.4 Temporal Perspective Space Theory (Bridgeford & Helm)

Consider N agents \{f_n(t)\}_{n=1}^N observed at T timepoints. For queries Q = \{q_1,\ldots,q_M\}, let X_n(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times R \times p} contain embedded responses, with X̄_n(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times p} the mean response matrix.

Define pairwise distance matrix D(t,t') with entries:

D_{nn'}(t,t') = \|X̄_n(t) - X̄_{n'}(t')\|_F

Let \tilde{D} be the TN \times TN block matrix with blocks D(t,t').

The Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS) representations \{\psi_n(t)\} solve:

\{\psi_n(t)\} = \arg\min_{z_i \in \mathbb{R}^d} \sum_{i,j=1}^{TN} (\|z_i - z_j\| - \tilde{D}_{ij})^2

Typically computed via classical multidimensional scaling.

Agent-Level Change Detection: Test H_0: f_n(t) \overset{d}{=} f_n(t') using statistic \|\psi_n(t) - \psi_n(t')\|. Significance assessed via permutation test that pools agent's replicates across timepoints and re-embeds using fixed basis.

Group-Level Change Detection: For agents in group \ell, test H_0: F_\ell(t) = F_\ell(t') using energy distance in TDKPS space:

\delta_\ell = 2\bar{D}_{tt'} - \bar{D}_t - \bar{D}_{t'}

where \bar{D}_{tt'} is average distance between embeddings at t and t', etc. Paired permutation test swaps time labels within agents.

3. The Manifold Passport: An Integrated Certification Framework

3.1 Definition and Components

A Manifold Passport for an AI system is a triple \mathcal{P} = (\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}) where:

1. Geometric Identity \mathcal{G} = (\text{dim}(\mathcal{M}), r, \mathcal{I})
   · \text{dim}(\mathcal{M}): Estimated intrinsic dimension of learned manifold
   · r: Hausdorff radius (empirical estimate \hat{r}_n)
   · \mathcal{I}: Set of topological invariants (Betti numbers, persistent homology)
2. Statistical Fidelity \mathcal{S} = (V(\alpha), \text{AUC}_{\text{cal}}, \text{CVaR}_\alpha^{\text{cal}})
   · V(\alpha): Quantile discrepancy function
   · \text{AUC}_{\text{cal}} = \int_0^1 V\left(\frac{1+\tau}{2}\right) d\tau: Calibrated average discrepancy
   · \text{CVaR}_\alpha^{\text{cal}} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\int_{1-\alpha}^1 V\left(\frac{1+u}{2}\right) du: Calibrated tail risk
3. Temporal Stability \mathcal{T} = (\Psi_t, \{\rho_{t,t'}\}, \mathcal{A})
   · \Psi_t: TDKPS embedding trajectory \{\psi(t)\}_{t=1}^T
   · \rho_{t,t'}: Hypothesis test p-values for changes between t and t'
   · \mathcal{A}: Drift alert system parameters

3.2 Certification Protocol

Phase 1: Geometric Characterization

1. Collect diverse samples \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N from target domain
2. Estimate intrinsic dimension via persistent homology or nearest-neighbor methods
3. Compute empirical Hausdorff radius \hat{r}_N relative to reference x_0
4. Verify saturation: monitor \hat{r}_n as function of n, certify when growth rate < threshold \epsilon

Phase 2: Statistical Validation

1. Define discrepancy measure L appropriate for domain
2. Generate calibration scenarios \{\psi_j\}_{j=1}^m from scenario distribution \Psi
3. For each scenario, compute confidence set \mathcal{C}_j(\hat{p}_j) and pseudo-discrepancy \hat{\Delta}_j
4. Construct quantile function estimate \hat{V}_m(\alpha)
5. Compute risk summaries \text{AUC}_{\text{cal}}, \text{CVaR}_\alpha^{\text{cal}}
6. Issue certificate with coverage guarantees from Theorem 2.5

Phase 3: Temporal Monitoring (Deployment)

1. Initialize TDKPS embedding with baseline data
2. For each monitoring interval t:
   · Compute updated embedding \psi(t)
   · Test H_0: f(t) \overset{d}{=} f(t-1) using agent-level test
   · If p < \alpha_{\text{alert}}, trigger investigation
3. Maintain stability log of test statistics

3.3 Mathematical Guarantees

Theorem 3.1 (Certification Completeness): If a system's passport \mathcal{P} satisfies:

1. \hat{r}_n has saturated (growth rate < \epsilon for n > N_0)
2. \text{CVaR}_{0.01}^{\text{cal}} < \tau_{\text{max}} (tail risk below threshold)
3. No significant drift detected for K consecutive periods (p > \alpha_{\text{stable}})

Then with probability at least 1 - \delta, the system operates within certified bounds for at least proportion 1 - \alpha^* of future inputs, where \alpha^* depends on \epsilon, \tau_{\text{max}}, \alpha_{\text{stable}}.

Proof Sketch: Combine convergence of \hat{r}_n (Theorem 2.2), coverage guarantee of quantile estimate (Theorem 2.5), and Type I error control of drift tests. □

5. Mathematical Appendix

5.1 Hausdorff Metric and Compactness

For a metric space (X,d), the Hausdorff distance between compact sets A,B \subset X is:

d_H(A,B) = \max\left\{\sup_{a \in A} \inf_{b \in B} d(a,b), \sup_{b \in B} \inf_{a \in A} d(a,b)\right\}

For perceptual manifold \mathcal{M} \subset C^0([0,T]), the perceptual radius is:

r = \sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}} d_H(\{x\},\{x_0\}) = \sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}} \|x - x_0\|_\infty

Proposition 5.1: If \mathcal{M} is compact, then for any \epsilon > 0, there exists a finite \epsilon-net N_\epsilon \subset \mathcal{M} such that:

\sup_{x \in \mathcal{M}} \inf_{y \in N_\epsilon} \|x - y\|_\infty < \epsilon

This provides theoretical basis for finite-sample approximation.

5.2 Quantile Estimation Theory

For i.i.d. samples \Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_m \sim F_\Delta, let F_m(t) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m 1_{\{\Delta_i \leq t\}} be the empirical CDF. By Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality:

\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{t \in \mathbb{R}} |F_m(t) - F_\Delta(t)| > \epsilon\right) \leq 2e^{-2m\epsilon^2}

This yields confidence bands for V(\alpha). The calibrated estimate uses:

\hat{V}_m^{\text{cal}}(\tau) = \hat{V}_m\left(\frac{1+\tau}{2}\right), \quad \tau \in [0,1]

to account for finite-sample uncertainty in both scenario sampling and parameter estimation.

5.3 TDKPS Statistical Tests

Agent-Level Test: Under H_0: f_n(t) \overset{d}{=} f_n(t'), the permutation distribution of \|\psi_n(t) - \psi_n(t')\| is obtained by:

1. Pooling replicates: \mathcal{X} = \{X_{nmr}(t), X_{nmr}(t') : m,r\}
2. Randomly partitioning into \mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2 of equal size
3. Re-embedding with fixed basis V\Sigma^{-1/2} from original SVD
4. Computing \|\tilde{\psi}_n(t) - \tilde{\psi}_n(t')\|

Theorem 5.2 (Type I Error Control): For B permutations, the test with rejection threshold at the (1-\alpha) quantile of permutation statistics has Type I error \leq \alpha + O(1/\sqrt{B}).

Group-Level Energy Distance: For distributions P, Q on \mathbb{R}^d, the energy distance is:

\mathcal{E}(P,Q) = 2\mathbb{E}\|X-Y\| - \mathbb{E}\|X-X'\| - \mathbb{E}\|Y-Y'\|

where X,X' \sim P, Y,Y' \sim Q, independent. This satisfies \mathcal{E}(P,Q) \geq 0 with equality iff P = Q.

For empirical distributions \hat{P}_t = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \delta_{\psi_i(t)}, the statistic becomes the form in Section 2.4.
