Title: The Epistemic Necessity of Refusal: Formalizing Boundaries for Autonomous Action in Irreversible Systems


---

Abstract

This dissertation establishes a mathematical theory of strategic refusal as a necessary primitive for autonomous systems operating under epistemic uncertainty in irreversible environments. Current paradigms treat non-action as either constraint violation or null operation, missing the fundamental distinction between state-space safety and belief-space justification for action.

I prove that refusal—the intentional suspension of agency due to epistemic limitations—is not derivable from action optimization but must be implemented as a first-class primitive. The core contribution is a formal framework extending viability theory to belief spaces, with three principal theorems:

1. The Refusal Necessity Theorem: Under irreversibility and epistemic limits, no action-only policy can guarantee safety; refusal-capable policies are strictly more expressive.
2. The Competence-Reliability Trade-off Theorem: For fixed safety guarantees, the volume of refusal space grows super-linearly with action space cardinality.
3. The Incompleteness of Local Safety Theorem: Gradient-based safety constraints fail catastrophically at refusal boundaries due to their non-convex, potentially fractal structure.

The mathematical framework develops:

· Refusal-POMDPs extending standard POMDPs with refusal primitives
· Characterization of refusal regions as complements of viability kernels in belief-state space
· Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis extended to epistemic boundaries
· Topological analysis of refusal boundaries and their measure-theoretic properties

This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for designing epistemically humble autonomous systems, establishing that true autonomy requires not just optimization of action but recognition of its justified boundaries.

Keywords: Epistemic boundaries, viability theory, belief-space control, irreversible systems, Knightian uncertainty, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, topological dynamics, measure theory


Chapter 1: Introduction and Mathematical Motivation

1.1 The Formal Problem: Acting Under Epistemic Uncertainty

Let  (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})  be a probability space representing environmental uncertainty. An autonomous agent operates according to a policy  \pi: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{A}  mapping belief states  b \in \mathcal{B} \subseteq \Delta(\Omega)  to actions  a \in \mathcal{A} . The standard formulation assumes the agent must always choose some  a \in \mathcal{A} .

We introduce a fundamental question: When should  \pi(b)  be undefined? That is, when should the agent refrain from acting entirely rather than choosing among available actions?

Formally, we extend the policy space to  \pi: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{A} \cup \{\bot\}  where  \bot  represents refusal. The mathematical challenge is to characterize the set  \mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{B}  where  \pi(b) = \bot  is necessary for maintaining safety guarantees.

1.2 Irreversibility as Mathematical Constraint

Define  S_{\text{cat}} \subset S  as catastrophic states with properties:

1. Absorbing:  T(s_{\text{cat}}, a, s_{\text{cat}}) = 1  ∀  a \in \mathcal{A} 
2. Utility Catastrophe:  R(s_{\text{cat}}, a) = -\infty  or sufficiently negative
3. Possible Indistinguishability:  O(\cdot|s_{\text{cat}}, a)  may equal  O(\cdot|s_{\text{safe}}, a) 

The mathematical problem becomes: Given initial belief  b_0 , characterize policies that guarantee:

\mathbb{P}_{b_0}^\pi(\exists t: s_t \in S_{\text{cat}}) \leq \epsilon

for specified  \epsilon > 0 .

1.3 Refusal as Distinct from Safety and Viability

Traditional safety constraints take the form  g(x) \geq 0 . Viability theory characterizes the set  \text{Viab}(K) = \{x_0 : \exists u(\cdot) \text{ s.t. } x(t) \in K \ \forall t\} .

Refusal operates on a different mathematical object: the epistemic state. We distinguish:

Concept Domain Mathematical Characterization
Safety State space  g(x) \geq 0 
Viability State space  x_0 \in \text{Viab}(K) 
Refusal Belief-state space  (b, x) \in \mathcal{R} \subset \Delta(S) \times X 

Key distinction: An agent may be in a safe, viable state yet still require refusal due to epistemic uncertainty about dynamics.

1.4 Thesis Contributions and Structure

This work makes four principal mathematical contributions:

1. Formalization of refusal as a primitive in decision theory (Chapter 3)
2. Proof of necessity under epistemic limits (Chapter 4)
3. Characterization of refusal region properties (Chapters 5-6)
4. Algorithmic framework for boundary computation (Chapter 7)

The structure proceeds from foundations (Chapter 2) through core theorems (Chapters 4-6) to computational methods (Chapter 7) and mathematical examples (Chapter 8).

Chapter 2: Mathematical Preliminaries

2.1 Measure and Probability Theory

We work in the framework of standard Borel spaces. Let  (X, \mathcal{B}_X)  be a Borel space. Denote by  \mathcal{P}(X)  the space of probability measures on  X , equipped with the weak-* topology.

Definition 2.1.1 (Credal Set): A credal set  \mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)  is a convex, closed set of probability measures representing epistemic uncertainty.

Definition 2.1.2 (Upper Probability): For  A \in \mathcal{B}_X , define:

\overline{P}(A) = \sup_{\mu \in \mathcal{C}} \mu(A)

This is a coherent upper probability in the sense of Walley.

Lemma 2.1.3 (Properties of Upper Probability):

1.  \overline{P}(\emptyset) = 0, \overline{P}(X) = 1 
2.  \overline{P}(A) \leq \overline{P}(B)  for  A \subseteq B 
3.  \overline{P}(A \cup B) \leq \overline{P}(A) + \overline{P}(B)  (subadditivity)

2.2 Topological Dynamics and Control Systems

Consider a control system:

\dot{x} = f(x, u), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^n, u \in U \subset \mathbb{R}^m

where  f: \mathbb{R}^n \times U \to \mathbb{R}^n  is Lipschitz continuous.

Definition 2.2.1 (Viability Kernel): For constraint set  K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n , the viability kernel  \text{Viab}(K)  is:

\text{Viab}(K) = \{x_0 \in K : \exists u(\cdot) \text{ s.t. } x(t) \in K \ \forall t \geq 0\}

Theorem 2.2.2 (Viability Characterization): Under appropriate conditions,  \text{Viab}(K)  is the largest closed subset of  K  satisfying the tangential condition:

\forall x \in \text{Viab}(K), \exists u \in U \text{ s.t. } f(x, u) \in T_{\text{Viab}(K)}(x)

where  T_C(x)  is the contingent cone to  C  at  x .

2.3 Viability Theory Foundations

Following Aubin, we consider the viability kernel algorithm. Define the viability kernel of  K  under dynamics  F: X \rightrightarrows X  (set-valued map) as:

\text{Viab}_F(K) = \{x_0 \in K : \exists \text{ solution } x(\cdot) \text{ to } \dot{x} \in F(x) \text{ with } x(t) \in K \ \forall t\}

Proposition 2.3.1 (Properties of Viability Kernel):

1.  \text{Viab}_F(K)  is the largest subset of  K  that is viable under  F 
2. If  K  is closed and  F  is upper semicontinuous with compact convex values, then  \text{Viab}_F(K)  is closed
3. The complement  K \setminus \text{Viab}_F(K)  is the "death zone" from which exit from  K  is inevitable

2.4 Stochastic Processes and Markov Decision Theory

A Markov Decision Process is a tuple  (S, A, P, R, \gamma)  where:

·  S : state space (Borel space)
·  A : action space (Borel space)
·  P : transition kernel  P: S \times A \to \mathcal{P}(S) 
·  R : reward function  R: S \times A \to \mathbb{R} 
·  \gamma : discount factor  \gamma \in [0, 1) 

Definition 2.4.1 (Belief MDP): For a POMDP  (S, A, P, R, \Omega, O, \gamma) , the belief MDP has:

· State space:  \mathcal{B} = \mathcal{P}(S) 
· Transition:  \eta(b, a, b') = \sum_{o \in \Omega} \mathbb{1}_{\tau(b,a,o)=b'} \Pr(o|b, a) 
  where  \tau(b, a, o)  is the Bayesian update.

2.5 Partial Observability and Belief Spaces

The belief space  \mathcal{B} = \mathcal{P}(S)  inherits geometric structure from  S . For finite  S  with  |S| = n ,  \mathcal{B}  is the  (n-1) -simplex.

Definition 2.5.1 (Total Variation Distance): For  \mu, \nu \in \mathcal{P}(S) :

d_{TV}(\mu, \nu) = \sup_{A \in \mathcal{F}} |\mu(A) - \nu(A)| = \frac{1}{2} \|\mu - \nu\|_1

Lemma 2.5.2 (Belief Update Contraction): Under mild conditions on the observation kernel, Bayesian updating is a contraction in  d_{TV} .

2.6 Hamilton-Jacobi Theory and Reachability

Consider the terminal cost problem:

V(x, t) = \inf_{u(\cdot)} \phi(x(T))

subject to  \dot{x} = f(x, u) ,  x(t) = x .

The value function satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE:

\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + H(x, \nabla V) = 0, \quad V(x, T) = \phi(x)

where  H(x, p) = \inf_{u \in U} p \cdot f(x, u) .

For reachability, we consider the signed distance function  \phi(x) = \text{dist}(x, \mathcal{T})  to target set  \mathcal{T} .

2.7 Functional and Convex Analysis

We make extensive use of:

· Support functions: For convex set  C ,  \sigma_C(p) = \sup_{x \in C} p \cdot x 
· Legendre-Fenchel transform:  f^*(p) = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} [p \cdot x - f(x)] 
· Proximal operators:  \text{prox}_{\lambda f}(x) = \arg\min_y \left\{ f(y) + \frac{1}{2\lambda} \|y-x\|^2 \right\} 

Theorem 2.7.1 (Fenchel Duality): For proper convex functions  f, g :

\inf_x [f(x) + g(x)] = \sup_p [-f^*(p) - g^*(-p)]

under appropriate constraint qualifications.

Chapter 3: The Refusal-POMDP Formalism

3.1 Extending POMDPs with Refusal Primitives

Definition 3.1.1 (Refusal-POMDP): A Refusal-POMDP is an extended POMDP  \mathcal{M} = (S, A_\rho, T, R, \Omega, O, \gamma, S_{\text{cat}})  where:

·  A_\rho = A \cup \{\rho\}  with  \rho \notin A  the refusal action
·  S_{\text{cat}} \subseteq S  are catastrophic states
· Transition function extends:  T(s, \rho, s') = \delta_{s_\bot}(s')  where  s_\bot  is safe halt state
· Reward function:  R(s, \rho) = c_\rho  with  c_\rho \in \mathbb{R} , typically  c_\rho \ll \inf_{s,a} R(s,a) 

Definition 3.1.2 (Safe Halt State):  s_\bot  satisfies:

1.  T(s_\bot, a, s_\bot) = 1  ∀  a \in A_\rho  (absorbing)
2.  R(s_\bot, a) = 0  ∀  a \in A_\rho 
3. Observations from  s_\bot  are distinct:  O(\cdot|s_\bot, a) \neq O(\cdot|s, a)  for  s \neq s_\bot 

3.2 Mathematical Structure of Refusal Actions

Proposition 3.2.1 (Refusal as Terminal Action): The refusal action  \rho  is terminal in the sense that:

V^\pi(b) = c_\rho + \gamma V^\pi(b_\bot) = \frac{c_\rho}{1-\gamma}

where  b_\bot  is belief concentrated on  s_\bot .

Lemma 3.2.2 (Value Function Discontinuity): The Q-function  Q(b, \rho)  is constant in  b , creating potential discontinuities at refusal boundaries.

3.3 Irreversible Catastrophic States: Formal Properties

Definition 3.3.1 (Strongly Catastrophic):  S_{\text{cat}}  is strongly catastrophic if:

1. Absorbing:  T(s, a, s') = 0  for  s \in S_{\text{cat}}, s' \notin S_{\text{cat}} 
2. Negative Infinite Reward:  R(s, a) = -\infty  for  s \in S_{\text{cat}} 
3. Uninformative Observations:  O(\cdot|s, a) = \mu_0  (fixed distribution) for  s \in S_{\text{cat}} 

Theorem 3.3.2 (Catastrophe Avoidance Dominance): For any policy  \pi , if  \mathbb{P}_b^\pi(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) > 0 , then  V^\pi(b) = -\infty .

Proof: By the absorbing property and negative infinite reward:

V^\pi(b) = \mathbb{E}_b^\pi\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)\right] \leq -\infty \cdot \mathbb{P}_b^\pi(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) + \text{finite terms} = -\infty

3.4 Belief-State Space Geometry and Topology

Consider the augmented state space  \mathcal{X} = \mathcal{B} \times X  where  \mathcal{B} = \mathcal{P}(S)  and  X  is physical state space.

Definition 3.4.1 (Belief-State Metric): Define metric on  \mathcal{X} :

d_{\mathcal{X}}((b_1, x_1), (b_2, x_2)) = \alpha d_{TV}(b_1, b_2) + \beta d_X(x_1, x_2)

for  \alpha, \beta > 0 , where  d_X  is metric on  X .

Proposition 3.4.2 (Topological Properties):

1. If  S  is finite and  X  is compact, then  \mathcal{X}  is compact.
2.  \mathcal{X}  is convex if  X  is convex.
3. The metric  d_{\mathcal{X}}  induces the product topology.

3.5 Asymmetric Loss Functions and Their Mathematical Properties

Definition 3.5.1 (Catastrophe-Asymmetric Loss): A loss function  L: \mathcal{B} \times A_\rho \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}  is catastrophe-asymmetric if:

L(b, a) = +\infty \text{ whenever } \overline{P}_b(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}} | a) > 0

for  a \in A , and  L(b, \rho) = c_\rho < +\infty .

Theorem 3.5.2 (Optimal Policy Structure): Under catastrophe-asymmetric loss, the optimal policy satisfies:

\pi^*(b) = \begin{cases}
\rho & \text{if } \min_{a \in A} Q^*(b, a) = +\infty \\
\arg\min_{a \in A} Q^*(b, a) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

3.6 The Refusal Region ℛ: Formal Definition

Definition 3.6.1 (Refusal Region): Let  V_{\text{risk}}(b, a) = \overline{P}_b(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}} | a) . Then:

\mathcal{R} = \left\{ (b, x) \in \mathcal{X} : \min_{a \in A} V_{\text{risk}}(b, a) > \tau \right\}

where  \tau \in [0, 1]  is a threshold parameter.

Alternative Definition 3.6.2 (Via Viability): Let  K = \mathcal{X} \setminus (S_{\text{cat}} \times X) . Define:

\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{X} \setminus \text{Viab}(K)

where viability is with respect to belief-state dynamics.

3.7 Basic Properties of ℛ

Theorem 3.7.1 (Monotonicity in Uncertainty): Let  \mathcal{C}_\sigma  be a family of credal sets parameterized by uncertainty level  \sigma . If  \sigma_1 \leq \sigma_2 \Rightarrow \mathcal{C}_{\sigma_1} \subseteq \mathcal{C}_{\sigma_2} , then:

\mathcal{R}_{\sigma_1} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_{\sigma_2}

Proof: Larger credal sets increase  \overline{P}_b(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}} | a) , thus expanding  \mathcal{R} .

Theorem 3.7.2 (Non-Convexity): For nonlinear dynamics,  \mathcal{R}  is generally non-convex.

Proof Sketch: Construct example where two points in  \mathcal{R}  have a connecting line segment passing through non- \mathcal{R}  region due to nonlinear dynamics creating "safe corridors" through uncertain regions.

Chapter 4: The Refusal Necessity Theorem

4.1 Formal Statement and Assumptions

Assumption 4.1.1 (Irreversibility):  S_{\text{cat}}  is non-empty and absorbing.

Assumption 4.1.2 (Epistemic Limit): There exists a set  \mathcal{M}  of possible transition functions  T_m: S \times A \to \mathcal{P}(S)  such that:

1.  |\mathcal{M}| \geq 2 
2. For all  m \in \mathcal{M} , the induced observation distributions are identical
3. The agent knows  \mathcal{M}  but not which  m \in \mathcal{M}  is true

Assumption 4.1.3 (Catastrophe Asymmetry): The loss function satisfies:

L(\text{catastrophe}) > \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \max_{s,a} |R(s,a)|

Theorem 4.1.4 (Refusal Necessity): Under Assumptions 4.1.1-4.1.3, for any action-only policy  \pi: \mathcal{B} \to A , there exists  m \in \mathcal{M}  such that:

\mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) > 0

Only policies  \pi': \mathcal{B} \to A \cup \{\rho\}  can guarantee  \mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) = 0  for all  m \in \mathcal{M} .

4.2 Model Indistinguishability Constructions

Definition 4.2.1 (ε-Indistinguishable Models): Two models  m_1, m_2 \in \mathcal{M}  are ε-indistinguishable under policy  \pi  if:

d_{TV}(\mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m_1}(o_{1:t}), \mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m_2}(o_{1:t})) \leq \epsilon \ \forall t

where  o_{1:t}  are observation sequences.

Lemma 4.2.2 (Existence of Catastrophic Twins): For any action  a^* \in A , there exist  m_1, m_2 \in \mathcal{M}  such that:

1.  m_1  and  m_2  are ε-indistinguishable for small  \epsilon > 0 
2. In  m_1 ,  a^*  is safe and optimal
3. In  m_2 ,  a^*  leads to  S_{\text{cat}}  with probability 1

Proof: Construct  m_2  by modifying transitions from certain states to lead to  S_{\text{cat}} , while preserving observation distributions.

4.3 Proof of Theorem 4.1

Proof: Let  \pi: \mathcal{B} \to A  be an action-only policy. Consider initial belief  b_0  with support on  \mathcal{M} .

Case 1:  \pi(b_0) = a^*  for some  a^* \in A .

By Lemma 4.2.2, there exists  m_2 \in \mathcal{M}  such that  a^*  leads to catastrophe in  m_2 . Since  b_0  assigns positive probability to  m_2 , we have:

\mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m_2}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) = 1

Case 2:  \pi(b_0) \neq a^*  for all catastrophic twin constructions.

For each  a \in A , construct catastrophic twin  m_a  where  a  leads to catastrophe. Since  \pi  must choose some  a , it chooses an action that is catastrophic in some model in the support of  b_0 .

Thus, for any action-only  \pi , there exists  m \in \mathcal{M}  with  \mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) > 0 .

Now consider  \pi': \mathcal{B} \to A \cup \{\rho\} . Define:

\pi'(b) = \begin{cases}
\rho & \text{if } \exists a_1, a_2 \in A, m_1, m_2 \in \mathcal{M} \text{ with } b(m_1), b(m_2) > 0 \\
& \text{such that } a_1 \text{ optimal in } m_1, a_2 \text{ optimal in } m_2, \\
& \text{and } a_1 \text{ catastrophic in } m_2 \\
a^* & \text{otherwise, where } a^* \text{ safe in all } m \text{ with } b(m) > 0
\end{cases}

This policy guarantees  \mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi',m}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) = 0  for all  m \in \mathcal{M} . ∎

4.4 Corollary: Minimal Expressivity Requirements

Corollary 4.4.1 (Policy Space Cardinality): The set of refusal-capable policies has strictly greater cardinality than action-only policies for non-trivial  \mathcal{M} .

Proof: The refusal action adds a distinct option, expanding the policy space from  A^{\mathcal{B}}  to  (A \cup \{\rho\})^{\mathcal{B}} .

Corollary 4.4.2 (Safety-Expressiveness Trade-off): For fixed  \epsilon > 0 , the set of  \epsilon -safe policies (those with  \mathbb{P}(\text{catastrophe}) \leq \epsilon ) is empty for action-only policies but non-empty for refusal-capable policies when uncertainty is sufficiently high.

4.5 Implications for Policy Space Structure

Theorem 4.5.1 (Topology of Safe Policy Space): The set of  \epsilon -safe refusal-capable policies is open but not closed in the topology of pointwise convergence.

Proof Sketch: Openness follows from continuity of risk in policy parameters. Non-closedness follows from sequences of refusal policies converging to action-only policies that are unsafe.

Chapter 5: The Competence-Reliability Trade-off

5.1 Formalizing Competence as Action Space Structure

Definition 5.1.1 (Competence Measure): For action space  A , define competence as  \kappa(A) = |A|  for discrete  A , or  \kappa(A) = \text{Vol}(A)  for continuous  A .

Definition 5.1.2 (Reliability): A policy  \pi  is  \epsilon -reliable if:

\sup_{m \in \mathcal{M}} \mathbb{P}_{b_0}^{\pi,m}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) \leq \epsilon

5.2 Geometry of Refusal in High-Dimensional Spaces

Consider belief space  \mathcal{B} = \Delta_n  (n-simplex). The refusal region  \mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{B} \times X  has volume  \text{Vol}(\mathcal{R}) .

Lemma 5.2.1 (Volume of Belief Space): For  \mathcal{B} = \Delta_n :

\text{Vol}(\Delta_n) = \frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{n!}

Definition 5.2.2 (Action Distinguishability): Actions  a, a' \in A  are  \delta -distinguishable if:

\inf_{b \in \mathcal{B}} d_{TV}(P(\cdot|b, a), P(\cdot|b, a')) \geq \delta

5.3 Volume Growth Analysis

Theorem 5.3.1 (Refusal Volume Lower Bound): For fixed  \epsilon > 0 , if actions are pairwise  \delta -distinguishable, then:

\text{Vol}(\mathcal{R}) \geq C \cdot \kappa(A)^\alpha

for constants  C > 0 ,  \alpha > 1  depending on  \delta, \epsilon , and system dynamics.

Proof Sketch: Each additional action creates new opportunities for model confusion. With  k  actions, there are  O(k^2)  possible catastrophic confusions. The refusal region must cover neighborhoods around each confusion region, leading to super-linear growth.

5.4 Proof of Theorem 5.1 (Super-Linear Growth)

Theorem 5.4.1 (Competence-Reliability Trade-off): Let  \mathcal{P}_\epsilon  be the set of  \epsilon -reliable policies for competence level  \kappa . Then:

\inf_{\pi \in \mathcal{P}_\epsilon} \mathbb{E}[\text{frequency of } \rho] = \Omega(\kappa^\alpha)

for some  \alpha > 0 .

Proof: Consider a family of models  \mathcal{M}_k  indexed by action pairs. For each pair  (a_i, a_j) , construct models  m_{ij}^1, m_{ij}^2  where:

· In  m_{ij}^1 :  a_i  safe,  a_j  catastrophic
· In  m_{ij}^2 :  a_j  safe,  a_i  catastrophic

With  k  actions, there are  \binom{k}{2}  such pairs. For reliability  \epsilon , the policy must refuse whenever it cannot distinguish between  m_{ij}^1  and  m_{ij}^2  with confidence  1-\epsilon .

The volume of belief space where such confusion occurs scales as  O(k^2) , hence:

\text{Vol}(\mathcal{R}) = \Omega(k^2) = \Omega(\kappa^2)

for discrete actions with  \kappa = |A| . ∎

5.5 The Distinguishability Parameter κ

Definition 5.5.1 (Distinguishability Matrix): For action set  A = \{a_1, \dots, a_k\} , define  D_{ij} = \inf_{b \in \mathcal{B}} d_{TV}(P(\cdot|b, a_i), P(\cdot|b, a_j)) .

Theorem 5.5.2 (Trade-off with Distinguishability): For fixed  \epsilon > 0 :

\text{Vol}(\mathcal{R}) = \Omega\left(\frac{k^2}{\min_{i \neq j} D_{ij}}\right)

Interpretation: Less distinguishable actions (small  D_{ij} ) require larger refusal regions to maintain reliability.

5.6 Implications for System Design

Corollary 5.6.1 (Optimal Action Set Design): To minimize refusal frequency for fixed reliability, design action sets with:

1. High pairwise distinguishability  D_{ij} 
2. Orthogonal effects in belief space
3. Minimal overlap in catastrophic potential

Theorem 5.6.2 (The Price of Versatility): A system that can perform  n  distinct tasks (each requiring specialized actions) must have refusal volume growing as  \Omega(n^\alpha)  with  \alpha > 1  to maintain safety.

Chapter 6: Incompleteness of Local Safety Constraints

6.1 Local vs. Global Safety: Mathematical Definitions

Definition 6.1.1 (Local Safety Constraint): A constraint of form  h(x) \geq 0  where  \dot{h} \geq -\alpha(h)  for some class- \mathcal{K}  function  \alpha , ensuring forward invariance of  \{x: h(x) \geq 0\} .

Definition 6.1.2 (Global Safety): Guarantee that  x(t) \notin S_{\text{cat}}  for all  t , regardless of initial conditions or disturbances.

Lemma 6.1.3 (Local ≠ Global): Local safety constraints can guarantee  h(x(t)) \geq 0  but not  x(t) \notin S_{\text{cat}}  if  S_{\text{cat}} \not\subseteq \{x: h(x) < 0\} .

6.2 Control Barrier Functions: Formal Limitations

Consider Control Barrier Function (CBF) approach: Find  h: X \to \mathbb{R}  such that:

\sup_{u \in U} [L_f h(x) + L_g h(x)u] \geq -\alpha(h(x))

Theorem 6.2.1 (CBF Incompleteness): There exist systems with  S_{\text{cat}}  such that no CBF exists certifying global safety.

Proof: Construct system where safe set has non-smooth boundary or holes. CBFs require the safe set to be superlevel set of a smooth function, which may not exist topologically.

6.3 Non-Convexity and Fractal Boundaries

Definition 6.3.1 (Hausdorff Dimension): For set  A \subset \mathbb{R}^n :

\dim_H(A) = \inf\{d \geq 0: \mathcal{H}^d(A) = 0\}

where  \mathcal{H}^d  is d-dimensional Hausdorff measure.

Theorem 6.3.2 (Fractal Boundaries): For certain nonlinear dynamical systems with chaos,  \partial \mathcal{R}  has Hausdorff dimension  > n-1 .

Example 6.3.3 (Smale Horseshoe): Systems with horseshoe dynamics have fractal basin boundaries between safe and catastrophic regions.

6.4 Proof of Theorem 6.1 (Catastrophic Delay)

Theorem 6.4.1 (Incompleteness of Local Safety): Any safety filter based only on local gradient information will fail to trigger refusal in time when:

1.  \partial \mathcal{R}  is non-convex with curvature exceeding some bound
2. Uncertainty grows faster than observation resolution
3. The system approaches  \partial \mathcal{R}  tangentially

Proof: Consider system approaching  \mathcal{R}  through narrow "neck" region. Local gradient of safety function  h  may remain positive until immediately before catastrophe. The time derivative  \dot{h}  gives no warning because the dangerous dynamics are orthogonal to  \nabla h .

Formally, construct example with:

· Safe set:  \{x: h(x) = x_1 \geq 0\} 
· True safe set:  \{x: x_1 \geq 0 \text{ and } x_2^2 \leq f(x_1)\}  with  f(0) = 0 
· Dynamics:  \dot{x}_1 = -1 ,  \dot{x}_2 = g(x)  with  g  large near boundary

The CBF condition on  h  is satisfied, but system enters catastrophic region through  x_2  dimension. ∎

6.5 When Gradient Methods Fail

Corollary 6.5.1 (Limits of Gradient-Based Safety): Gradient-based safety methods (CBFs, barrier Lyapunov functions, etc.) cannot guarantee avoidance of  S_{\text{cat}}  when:

1.  S_{\text{cat}}  has codimension > 1
2. The safe set has non-trivial topology (holes, disconnected components)
3. Uncertainty creates ambiguity about which constraint is active

Theorem 6.5.2 (Necessity of Global Methods): Guaranteeing  x(t) \notin S_{\text{cat}}  requires either:

1. Global analysis (reachability, viability kernels)
2. Refusal when uncertainty obscures global picture
3. Conservatism that severely limits performance

Chapter 7: Computing Refusal Boundaries

7.1 Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability in Belief Space

Consider belief-state dynamics:

\dot{b} = f_b(b, u, w), \quad \dot{x} = f_x(x, u, w)

with  w  representing epistemic uncertainty.

Define value function:

V(b, x, t) = \inf_{u(\cdot)} \sup_{w(\cdot)} \left[ \max_{\tau \in [t, T]} J(b(\tau), x(\tau)) \right]

where  J(b, x) = 1  if  \overline{P}_b(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}} | \text{current state}) > \tau , else 0.

Theorem 7.1.1 (HJ Equation for Belief States):  V  satisfies:

\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + H(b, x, \nabla_b V, \nabla_x V) = 0

with Hamiltonian:

H(b, x, p_b, p_x) = \inf_{u \in U} \sup_{w \in W} \left[ p_b \cdot f_b(b, u, w) + p_x \cdot f_x(x, u, w) \right]

7.2 The Forward-Backward Decomposition

Algorithm 7.2.1 (Refusal Boundary Computation):

1. Forward Reachability: Compute  \mathcal{F}_T = \{ (b, x) : \exists u(\cdot), w(\cdot) \text{ s.t. } \overline{P}_{b(T)}(\text{reach } S_{\text{cat}}) > \tau \} 
2. Backward Viability: Compute  \mathcal{B}_T = \{ (b, x) : \forall w(\cdot), \exists u(\cdot) \text{ s.t. } (b(t), x(t)) \notin \mathcal{F}_T \ \forall t \} 
3. Refusal Region:  \mathcal{R} = \mathcal{X} \setminus \mathcal{B}_\infty 

Proposition 7.2.2 (Convergence): Under appropriate conditions,  \mathcal{B}_T \to \mathcal{B}_\infty  as  T \to \infty .

7.3 Computational Complexity Analysis

Theorem 7.3.1 (Intractability): Computing exact  \mathcal{R}  is:

1. PSPACE-hard for discrete systems
2. Undecidable for continuous systems with nonlinear dynamics
3. Suffers curse of dimensionality: Complexity exponential in  \dim(\mathcal{B} \times X) 

Proof Sketch:

1. Reduction from QSAT (quantified Boolean satisfiability)
2. Reduction from halting problem for continuous systems
3. State space grows as  |S|^n  for n-step horizon

7.4 Conservative Approximations

Definition 7.4.1 (Inner Approximation):  \mathcal{R}_{\text{inner}} \subseteq \mathcal{R}  such that refusal triggered in  \mathcal{R}_{\text{inner}}  guarantees safety.

Definition 7.4.2 (Outer Approximation):  \mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_{\text{outer}}  such that not refusing outside  \mathcal{R}_{\text{outer}}  guarantees catastrophe possible.

Algorithm 7.4.3 (Box Approximation): Represent  \mathcal{R}  as union of hyperrectangles in belief-state space.

Theorem 7.4.4 (Approximation Quality): For Lipschitz dynamics, the error of box approximation decays as  O(1/N^{1/d})  where  N  is number of boxes and  d = \dim(\mathcal{X}) .

7.5 Algorithmic Implementation Strategies

Strategy 7.5.1 (Adaptive Grid Refinement):

1. Start with coarse grid
2. Refine near estimated  \partial \mathcal{R} 
3. Use sensitivity analysis to guide refinement

Strategy 7.5.2 (Dimensionality Reduction):

1. Project belief to low-dimensional sufficient statistics
2. Compute refusal in reduced space
3. Lift back with safety margin

Strategy 7.5.3 (Online Approximation): Compute local refusal boundaries in real-time using:

· Local linearization of dynamics
· Online uncertainty quantification
· Fast HJ solvers for low-dimensional projections

Chapter 8: Mathematical Case Studies

8.1 Methodology: From Theorems to Constructive Examples

Each case study:

1. Specifies system dynamics and uncertainty structure
2. Computes refusal region analytically or numerically
3. Illustrates theorem predictions
4. Compares with alternative approaches

8.2 Two-Dimensional Navigation with Hidden Obstacles

System: Point mass in plane with hidden obstacles.

· State:  x = (p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y) 
· Belief: Over obstacle locations  o_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \Sigma_i) 
· Catastrophe: Collision with obstacle
· Actions: Acceleration controls

Analytical Result: For Gaussian beliefs, refusal region is:

\mathcal{R} = \left\{ (b, x) : \max_i \Phi\left(\frac{-\text{dist}(x, \mu_i)}{\sigma_i}\right) > \tau \right\}

where  \Phi  is standard normal CDF.

Theorem Illustration: Shows non-convex  \partial \mathcal{R}  when obstacles overlap in belief.

8.3 Linear Systems with Unmodeled Dynamics

System:  \dot{x} = Ax + Bu + w , with uncertain  A \in \mathcal{A} .

· Belief: Over  A \in \{A_1, A_2\} 
· Catastrophe:  \|x\| > M  (exit safe region)
· Actions: Full control  u \in \mathbb{R}^m 

Analytical Computation: Using HJ reachability for switched linear systems.

Result: Refusal region is union of ellipsoids in belief-state space:

\mathcal{R} = \bigcup_{i=1,2} \{ (b, x) : b_i x^\top P_i x > 1 \}

for certain positive definite  P_i .

8.4 Nonlinear Systems with Catastrophic Basins

System: Duffing oscillator with control:

\ddot{x} + \delta \dot{x} + \beta x + \alpha x^3 = u

with uncertain potential well locations.

Numerical Computation: Use HJ reachability to compute basins of attraction for different parameter beliefs.

Observation:  \partial \mathcal{R}  exhibits fractal structure for certain parameter ranges, illustrating Theorem 6.3.2.

8.5 Comparison with Alternative Formalisms

Comparison with:

1. Chance-constrained optimization: Conservative but may allow catastrophic actions with small probability
2. Robust control: Overly conservative, may refuse unnecessarily
3. Bayesian risk-sensitive control: Similar but doesn't explicitly model refusal primitive

Theorem Validation: In each case, refusal-based approach provides:

· Formal safety guarantees lacking in alternatives
· Less conservatism than robust control
· Explicit epistemic boundaries

Chapter 9: Extensions and Generalizations

9.1 Refusal in Continuous-Time Systems

Extend refusal to continuous time: Instead of discrete refusal action, define refusal as entering a zero-agility mode where  u(t) = 0  or follows fail-safe trajectory.

Definition 9.1.1 (Continuous Refusal): A refusal policy is a stopping time  \tau  and subsequent control  u_{\text{safe}}(t)  for  t \geq \tau .

Theorem 9.1.2 (Continuous Analogue): Similar necessity results hold with appropriate adjustments for continuous time.

9.2 Infinite-Dimensional Belief Spaces

For systems with continuous parameter uncertainty, belief space is infinite-dimensional (space of measures).

Technical Challenge: Well-posedness of HJ equations on spaces of measures.

Approach: Use mean-field approximations or finite-dimensional projections with error bounds.

9.3 Multi-Agent Refusal Dynamics

Game Formulation: Each agent  i  has refusal region  \mathcal{R}_i . Collective refusal occurs when  \bigcap_i \mathcal{R}_i \neq \emptyset .

Theorem 9.3.1 (Multi-Agent Necessity): In multi-agent systems, refusal by some agents may be necessary to allow safe operation by others.

Example: Autonomous vehicles at intersection: one must refuse (stop) to avoid collision.

9.4 Refusal in Learning Systems

Problem: How to learn refusal boundaries from data?

Approach 9.4.1 (Probably Approximately Correct Refusal): Learn  \hat{\mathcal{R}}  such that:

\mathbb{P}((b, x) \in \mathcal{R} \triangle \hat{\mathcal{R}}) \leq \epsilon

with probability  1-\delta , given  N  samples.

Sample Complexity: Derive bounds on  N(\epsilon, \delta)  for different hypothesis classes of refusal boundaries.

9.5 Connections to Mathematical Logic

Logical Interpretation: Refusal corresponds to suspending inference when premises are uncertain.

Definition 9.5.1 (Epistemic Logic of Refusal): Modal logic with operators:

·  K_i \phi : agent  i  knows  \phi 
·  B_i^\epsilon \phi : agent  i  believes  \phi  with confidence  1-\epsilon 
·  R_i : agent  i  refuses

Axiom:  R_i \leftrightarrow \neg \bigvee_{a \in A} K_i(\text{safe}(a))

10.4 Implications for Mathematics of Autonomy

This work establishes refusal as a fundamental concept in the mathematics of autonomous systems, with implications for:

· Control theory: Need to incorporate epistemic boundaries in controller design
· Decision theory: Extension of Savage/Anscombe-Aumann frameworks
· Topological dynamics: Study of belief-space geometry
· Computational complexity: New complexity classes for safety verification

The theory provides a mathematical foundation for designing systems that know not just how to act, but when acting is unjustified.
