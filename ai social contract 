Here is the Executive Summary (2 pages) fully rewritten in English, with the tone, structure, and precision expected in a high-level policy document for ministers, government advisors, CEOs, and strategic investors.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — WHITE PAPER

“AI: Choose Sovereignty or Dependency”

Building the New Human–AI Social Contract


---

PAGE 1 — DIAGNOSIS & VISION

A Historic Decision Point

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a sectoral technology — it is becoming the cognitive infrastructure of nations.
This White Paper presents a decisive strategic choice: develop sovereign AI capabilities, or fall into systemic dependency on foreign platforms.

The question is no longer whether AI will transform the economy and democracy —
but who will control that transformation.

The Three Strategic Paradoxes

1. The Paradox of Fear

Citizens increasingly use AI in their daily lives, yet fear its systemic consequences.
➡️ Policy Response: Restore trust through transparency, alignment, and democratic oversight (the Sovereignty Chamber).

2. The Paradox of Speed

Governments operate at administrative pace; AI advances at exponential speed.
➡️ Policy Response: Build an Augmented Administration capable of regulating, adapting, and innovating in near real time.

3. The Paradox of Power

Data and models create immense value — yet citizens who generate the data receive none of it.
➡️ Policy Response: Recognize data as a national asset through a Data Dividend model.

The Vision: The New Human–AI Contract

At the center of this strategy stands the concept of the:

Co-Human

The human augmented — not replaced — by sovereign, ethical AI systems.

The New Contract rests on three foundational principles:

1. Humans remain the decision-makers (cultural veto guaranteed by the Sovereignty Chamber).


2. AI becomes an institutional partner, accelerating governance and public services.


3. AI-generated wealth returns to citizens, through redistribution and lifelong learning.



In this model, AI becomes a lever for sovereignty, competitiveness, and social cohesion.

PAGE 2 — ARCHITECTURE & ACTION

The Integrated 3-Pillar Architecture of Cognitive Sovereignty

1. FS-MLC — The Sovereign Fund for Models & Compute

A national fund dedicated to:

Financing sovereign AI models (open-source and proprietary),

Building strategic compute capacity,

Supporting advanced research.


➡️ The technological engine.


---

2. AC-HIA — The Human–AI Contract Agency

The operational body responsible for:

Ethical supervision and alignment,

Managing licenses and sovereign model access,

Protecting cultural and creative industries,

Administering the CAP (Continuous Learning Credit).


➡️ The democratic safeguard.


---

3. CAP + Data Dividend — The Social Redistribution Mechanism

Instead of a Universal Basic Income, the White Paper proposes a more precise, future-proof model:

Data Dividend:
Every commercial use of national or public data generates a micro-payment that finances the FS-MLC.

CAP — Continuous Learning Credit:
A dedicated public allocation for upskilling, reskilling, and cognitive augmentation programs.


➡️ The circular economic engine.

The 6 Priority Measures (Selected from the Full 12-Measure Roadmap)

1. Establish the National Data Dividend

Turn national data streams into a stable public revenue source dedicated to AI sovereignty.

2. Launch the FS-MLC and Build National Compute Capability

Ensure technological independence from foreign hyperscalers and cloud monopolies.

3. Deploy the Continuous Learning Credit (CAP)

Equip citizens with the skills required to thrive in the augmented economy.

4. Create the Sovereignty Chamber (CDS)

Guarantee algorithmic transparency, cultural protection, and democratic veto power.

5. Build the Augmented Administration

Use AI to accelerate regulation, reduce administrative cost, and increase state agility.

6. Develop Sovereign Open-Source Models

Stimulate a national ecosystem of startups, SMEs, and cultural industries leveraging shared AI infrastructure.

Call to Action: The Cost of Inaction

Failure to act immediately will lead to:

Structural dependence on foreign cognitive infrastructures,

Loss of technological autonomy in critical sectors,

An economy where productivity grows but citizens’ incomes do not.


By contrast, adopting the Co-Human strategy will:

Build a competitive sovereign AI ecosystem,

Ensure automated national reinvestment through the Data Dividend,

Restore fair redistribution and social mobility,

Protect culture, democracy, and long-term national stability.

Conclusion: The Moment to Choose

AI sovereignty is not a cost —
it is the highest-yield national investment of the 21st century.

This White Paper delivers the only integrated architecture — technological, institutional, and social — capable of turning AI into a durable engine of prosperity, capability, and independence.

The window of opportunity is now.
