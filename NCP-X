1. Executive Summary: The Simulation Hypothesis

The NCP-X is a theory of operation, instantiated in code. Its purpose is to test whether a propulsion system governed by a POMDP, inferring hidden degradation from synthetic sensors, can achieve greater simulated mission reliability (P_success > 99%) than a traditional redline-shutdown controller, despite being burdened by the high thermodynamic density and partial observability of a monolithic design.

The framework's credibility is governed by a triage system:

· 🔵 Validated Model: Foundational physics with low uncertainty.
· 🟡 Parametric Model: Empirical correlations scaled to extreme regimes; medium uncertainty.
· 🔴 Hypothetical Model: Novel formulations based on literature extrapolation; high uncertainty.

Final Benchmark: In 10,000 Monte Carlo runs of the simulated 480-second Mars ascent, the NCP-X autonomous controller must exceed a 99% success rate, outperforming a traditional controller by a minimum of 10 percentage points.

2. Foundational Physics & Thermodynamic Models

2.2 Full-Flow Staged Combustion Cycle

· Preburner & Mass/Energy Balance: ṁ_o,pb*h_o + ṁ_f,pb*h_f = (ṁ_o,pb+ṁ_f,pb)*h_out + Q_loss. Status: 🔵.
· Turbopump Performance: Pump maps (ψ, φ, η) extrapolated from published data. Turbine efficiency η_turb as function of expansion ratio. Status: 🟡. Scaling to 350-bar discharge is a key uncertainty.
· Thrust Chamber Performance: F = ṁ*v_e + (p_e-p_a)A_e, mass flow via throat condition. Status: 🔵.

2.3 Regenerative Cooling & Heat Transfer

· Gas-Side Heat Flux: Bartz correlation h_g = 0.026/D_t^0.2 * (μ^0.2 c_p/Pr^0.6) * (p_c/c*)^0.8 * (D_t/R_c)^0.1. Status: 🟡. Requires real-gas correction factor Φ at 350 bar, introducing +/- 30% uncertainty.
· Wall Conduction: 1D steady-state solution for temperature profile. Status: 🔵.
· Coolant-Side (Transcritical): Nusselt correlation with pseudo-critical enhancement E(T,p). Status: 🟡. Microgravity and high-acceleration effects are not fully modeled.

3. Structural & Material Degradation Models

3.1 Monolithic Chamber Mechanics

· Thermal Stress: σ_θ = [Eα/(1-ν)] * [1/r² ∫ T r dr + (r²+r_i²)/(r²(r_o²-r_i²)) ∫ T r dr - T(r)]. Status: 🔵.
· Low-Cycle Fatigue (LCF): Coffin-Manson relation: Δε_plastic/2 = ε_f' (2N_f)^c. Status: 🔵. Includes Mars cold-start transient strain Δε_therm(t).

3.2 High-Pressure Degradation (The Critical Unknowns)

· High-Pressure Oxidation: dx_ox/dt = k_l0 * exp(-Q_l/RT) * (p_O2)^m. Status: 🔴. This is the highest-risk model. Constants m and Q_l at p_O2 > 100 bar are literature extrapolations. The proposed DOE is required to transition this to 🟡.
· Coking: ṁ_coke = A_c * p_CH4 * exp(-E_c/(R T_w)). Status: 🟡. Considered a slow, secondary process.

4. The Perception Layer: Neural Cluster Decoupler (NCD)

4.1 Synthetic Sensor & Noise Generation

· Process: The physics simulator generates a ground-truth state S_true. A sensor model adds Gaussian noise 𝒩(μ, σ) to performance parameters (e.g., p_c ± 2 bar).
· Acoustic Emission (AE) Synthesis: AE_raw(t) = FFT^{-1}[ Σ_Cluster_Noise + Spallation_Event(δ_TBC) ]. Status: 🤖 (ML Model). Noise profile includes broadband roar and turbopump harmonics.

4.2 Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) Architecture

· Purpose: A denoising autoencoder that maps 33 channels of AE_raw(t) to a clean signal for a target engine.
· Input: (batch, 33, time_seq). Includes spatial embedding for engine position.
· Core: Multi-head self-attention layers followed by convolutional decoder.
· Output: Residual Anomaly Energy E_res(t). Status: 🤖. Trained entirely on synthetic data pairs (AE_raw, clean_event).

4.3 MISO Delay-and-Sum Beamformer

· Process: Time-aligns signals based on known engine geometry and sound speed in structure (v_s ≈ 5000 m/s): y_target(t) = Σ_j w_j * x_j(t + τ_ij).
· Status: 🟡. Physics is sound (🔵), but effectiveness depends on accurate modeling of wave propagation in the monolithic block, which is complex (🟡).

5. The Intelligence Layer: POMDP Control Core

5.1 Formal POMDP Definition (S, A, O, T, Ω, R, γ)

· States S: Hidden degradation states (e.g., [δ_TBC, x_ox, ω_fatigue]).
· Actions A: Continuous vector [throttle, ΔO/F, ITC_power, coolant_override].
· Observations O: Noisy sensor outputs O_sim(t), including E_res from NCD.
· Transition Model T(s'|s,a): Defined by the physics models in Sections 2 & 3. This is the simulator's internal truth. Status: 🟡/🔴. Credibility depends on constituent models.
· Observation Model Ω(o|s',a): A learned neural network. Estimates probability of sensor reading o given true state s'. Status: 🤖. Trained on millions of (S_true, O_sim) pairs from the simulator.
· Reward R(s,a): R = w1*R_perf + w2*R_health + w3*R_mission - w4*R_penalty. Includes exponential penalty for high p_O2 and T_wall.

5.2 Belief State & The Bayesian Filter

The controller maintains a probability distribution b_t(s) over hidden states, updated via:
b_{t+1}(s') ∝ Ω(o_{t+1} | s', a_t) • Σ_s T(s' | s, a_t) • b_t(s)
This fuses the NCD's anomaly detection with model-based predictions.

5.3 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

· Setup: 33 parallel instances of the simulator, coupled acoustically and thermally via view factors F_ij.
· Architecture: Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE). A global critic learns cooperative strategies; each engine runs a local actor π_i(a_i | o_i, b_i(s)).
· Differentiated Policies: Inner-ring engines weight R_health more; outer-ring engines weight R_perf more to compensate.
· The "Firebreak" Protocol: A hard-coded sequence triggered by a high-confidence breach belief (P(S_4) > 0.8) to isolate a failing engine and shield its neighbors.

7. Path to De-Risking & Physical Reality

7.1 Critical Path: Transitioning 🔴 to 🟡

The single most important action is executing the High-Pressure Oxidation DOE:

1. Objective: Empirically determine m and Q_l at p_O2 = 100-400 bar, T = 900-1300 K.
2. Outcome: Replace literature extrapolations with fitted constants and uncertainty bounds.
3. Ripple Effect: Recalibrates the Transition Model T(s'|s,a), the Observation Model Ω, and requires retraining the POMDP policy. This work transitions the largest 🔴 to a quantified 🟡.

7.2 The "Iron Bird" Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Phase

· Purpose: Test the AI stack against real-world latency using actual flight computers and actuators connected to the real-time simulator.
· Key Test: "Time-to-Truth" must be < 150ms for the control loop (sensor → NCD → POMDP → actuator command).
· Success Criterion: 99.9% mission success rate in HIL with fault injection.

7.3 Final Implementation Roadmap

1. Complete DOE & Model Recalibration. (Transition 🔴→🟡)
2. HIL Testing & Latency Validation. (Validate 🤖 stack)
3. Sub-Scale Component Hot Fire. (First physical validation of coupled models)
4. Full System Demonstration.

8. Conclusion: The Blueprint as a Falsifiable Hypothesis

The NCP-X Final Blueprint is not a construction document. It is a detailed, uncertainty-quantified proposal for a computational experiment. Its value lies in providing a complete, self-consistent framework to test a revolutionary approach to engine control. The explicit labeling of 🔴🟡🔵 forces rigorous confrontation with knowledge gaps and directs research resources to where they are most needed: empirically resolving the high-pressure oxidation frontier.

By following this plan, the outcome will be unambiguous: either the autonomous framework demonstrably achieves its reliability target in high-fidelity simulation, justifying a massive investment in physical development, or it reveals fundamental flaws in the concept, saving equal resources. This is the essence of simulation-first design.
