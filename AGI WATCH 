AGI Watch: A Civic Oversight Framework for AGI Development

White Paper v2.0
Date: November 2024
Status: Realistic Proposal for Initial Implementation

---

Executive Summary: A Focused, Phased Approach

The development of Artificial General Intelligence presents unprecedented governance challenges. Current trajectories risk catastrophic outcomes due to corporate secrecy, geopolitical competition, and inadequate safety measures.

AGI Watch proposes a realistic, phased civic response centered on one core premise: Transparency must precede accountability. We begin with a focused mission—aggregating and analyzing publicly available information about AGI development—before expanding to advocacy and resilience building.

This revised framework addresses critical feedback by:

1. Starting with what's feasible: Beginning with information synthesis rather than comprehensive monitoring
2. Building credibility first: Establishing value through high-quality analysis before expanding scope
3. Phasing growth responsibly: Proving impact at each stage before scaling
4. Acknowledging limitations: Being transparent about what we can and cannot track

We invite participation in building essential civic infrastructure for navigating the AGI transition.

---

1. Introduction: The Transparency Imperative

1.1 The Problem: Information Asymmetry

The "AI 2027" scenario reveals a critical failure: decision-makers and the public lack timely, accurate information about AGI progress. This creates:

· Reactive policymaking: Governments respond to crises rather than shaping development
· Uninformed public debate: Discussions lack grounding in technical reality
· Safety neglect: Competitive pressures overwhelm caution without visibility

1.2 Our Realistic Theory of Change

We operate on three evidence-based principles:

1. Information changes behavior: When companies know they're being watched, they act more responsibly (the "observer effect")
2. Quality synthesis creates leverage: Decision-makers facing information overload value curated, credible analysis
3. Networked expertise beats centralization: Distributed contributors can track developments no single organization can

1.3 Acknowledged Limitations

We explicitly recognize:

· Much cutting-edge research occurs in private settings
· True capability assessments require insider access
· Public pressure alone rarely changes corporate behavior
· Our influence will be gradual, not revolutionary

---

2. Revised Mission & Phased Vision

---

9. Addressing Critical Feedback

9.1 On Scope and Feasibility

We accept that our initial proposal was over-ambitious. This revised framework:

· Focuses on one core competency (information synthesis)
· Explicitly defers advocacy and resilience work until later
· Sets realistic targets based on comparable organizations' growth

9.2 On Technical Monitoring Challenges

We acknowledge that:

· Much important information is not publicly available
· We cannot provide comprehensive monitoring
· Our value comes from curation and synthesis, not surveillance

9.3 On Theory of Change

We now articulate a clearer path:

1. Build credibility through high-quality analysis
2. Become indispensable to time-constrained decision-makers
3. Gain influence by framing issues and providing unique insights
4. Collaborate with organizations that have direct advocacy power

9.4 On Psychological Framing

We adopt more accessible language:

· "Navigating technological change" instead of "Post-AGI Life Skills"
· Focus on understanding and adaptation rather than survival
· Emphasize agency and opportunity alongside risks

9.5 On Funding Realism

We propose:

· Lower initial targets ($15k pilot, $100k Year 1)
· Clear value proposition for funders (unique information synthesis)
· Gradual scaling based on demonstrated impact

---

10. Conclusion: A Path Forward

The AGI governance challenge requires new forms of civic engagement. While the ultimate need may be comprehensive, the path to get there must be incremental and evidence-based.

AGI Watch v2.0 represents a realistic starting point: building the information infrastructure necessary for informed debate and decision-making. By proving we can provide unique value in synthesizing technical developments for broader audiences, we lay the foundation for more ambitious oversight mechanisms.

10.1 Immediate Next Steps

1. Form founding team (3 committed individuals)
2. Secure initial funding ($15,000 for 90-day pilot)
3. Launch newsletter and basic website
4. Build volunteer network (10-15 initial contributors)

10.2 Invitation to Collaborate

We seek:

· Researchers interested in communicating their work
· Policy professionals needing better information
· Concerned citizens with relevant skills (writing, research, community building)
· Funders who believe in the power of transparency

The "AI 2027" scenario reminds us that passive observation is insufficient. But effective action requires starting where we are, with what we have, and building methodically from there.

AGI Watch Implementation Assets: From Vision to Action

1. Call for Founding Contributors

Subject: Join the Founding Team of AGI Watch: Building Civic Infrastructure for the AGI Era

The Problem We're Solving:
The"Information Asymmetry" between AGI labs and the public is the single greatest barrier to safe development. While technical progress accelerates behind closed doors, policymakers, journalists, and concerned citizens lack timely, synthesized intelligence to make informed decisions. This gap creates reactive governance, polarized public discourse, and unchecked competitive pressures.

Our Solution:
AGI Watch is launching a 90-day pilot to build the essential"middle layer" of civic intelligence. We are not just another AI newsletter. We are a civic oversight framework focused on technical synthesis for decision-makers—the connective tissue between cutting-edge research and responsible governance.

Why This Matters Now:
The window for shaping AGI's trajectory is narrowing.The next 12-24 months will see unprecedented investments in compute infrastructure, algorithmic breakthroughs, and geopolitical positioning.

2. Sample Executive Brief: AGI Progress Digest #001

AGI Watch: The Progress Digest
Issue #001 | March 15, 2024 | Focus: The Compute-Intelligence Ratio Shift

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-Minute Read)

This week's data indicates a strategic pivot from model architecture to infrastructure-led scaling. While public attention remains focused on chatbot capabilities, the critical signal is the 30% increase in data center construction permits in the Southwest U.S. power corridor—a high-confidence indicator of upcoming training runs exceeding 10²⁸ FLOP.

Bottom Line for Decision-Makers: Current policy frameworks tracking compute via FLOP thresholds are becoming obsolete. New efficiency breakthroughs allow 2x the effective intelligence per hardware unit, bypassing proposed oversight triggers. We recommend shifting regulatory focus from "hardware used" to "measured capability benchmarks."

---

TECHNICAL SYNTHESIS: WHAT MATTERS THIS WEEK

📄 Paper of the Week: "Sparse Activation Pathways" (arXiv:2403.xxxxx)

· The Gist: New training method reduces compute requirements by 40% while maintaining performance.
· The 'So What': This effectively doubles the intelligence yield per dollar of compute investment.
· Confidence: High (reproduced across 3 model scales, peer-reviewed methodology)
· Implication: Companies can now train models with capabilities that would previously have triggered compute-based oversight, without exceeding hardware thresholds.

📈 Capability Index Update

Our proprietary AGI Progress Index rose 2.1 points this month (now at 34.7/100), driven by:

· +1.5 points: Advances in autonomous agents' long-horizon planning
· +0.4 points: Improvements in scientific reasoning benchmarks
· +0.2 points: Code generation for novel architectures

Note: The Capability Index weights advances by their implications for recursive self-improvement potential.

🔍 Pattern Recognition

We're observing convergence across three research streams:

1. Efficiency algorithms (like Sparse Activation)
2. Data curation automation (synthetic data pipelines)
3. Automated alignment research (AI-assisted oversight)

This suggests labs are preparing for continuous training regimes rather than discrete model releases.

---

POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR STAFFERS

Immediate Action Items:

1. Update the "Model Audit Act" draft: Shift trigger from ">10²⁷ FLOP" to ">80th percentile on standard capability benchmarks."
2. Request briefing from NIST: Ask for timeline on updating AI risk management framework to account for efficiency breakthroughs.
3. Schedule hearing: "Oversight in an Era of Exponential Efficiency Gains" with testimonies from compute economists and safety researchers.

Questions for Agency Heads:

· "How is your department tracking effective capability rather than raw compute?"
· "What mechanisms exist for updating oversight thresholds quarterly rather than annually?"
· "How are we preparing for models that improve continuously rather than being released discretely?"

1. Direct line to editors for topic requests
2. Weekly feedback surveys on utility
3. Invitation to monthly "editorial roundtable" calls
4. Early access to database tools

Implementation Table

Feature Purpose Implementation (Weeks 1-12) Success Metric
"The Briefing Room" High-utility, low-noise entry point 500-word staffer summary at top; never exceeds 2-minute read time 70%open rate from .gov/.org emails
Expert Matchmaking Build Pillar 2 (Advocacy) foundation "Request an Expert" button → 15-minute calendly slots with our network 10+ expert-staffer connections made

2. Quotable feedback: "This is the only thing that helps me prepare for AI hearings"
3. Before/after examples: Showing how our synthesis changed policy language

Transition to Phase 2

If we hit 80% of our targets, we will:

1. Launch premium tier: $500/month for agencies needing custom briefings
2. Expand team: Hire first full-time analyst
3. Build advisory board: Including former regulators and respected researchers
4. Publish "State of AGI Governance" report: Comprehensive analysis with policy recommendations

Your Next Step

If you're ready to build this with us:

1. Share these assets with 3 people who should join the founding team
2. Identify 5 policy staffers who would benefit from the pilot digest
3. Reply with which implementation aspect you want to own first

If you need modifications before proceeding:

1. Specify which element needs adjustment
2. Provide concrete alternative language or structure
3. Set a deadline for revised version

Time is our scarcest resource. The 90-day pilot window begins when we have:
✓3 founding contributors committed
✓ $15,000 in initial funding secured
✓ 50 policy staffers pre-registered for the digest

Which will you help secure first?

---

These implementation assets transform our White Paper from a document into a movement. The machinery is designed, the value proposition is clear, and the need is urgent. The only remaining question is who will build it.
