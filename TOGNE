Abstract

This dissertation establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for detecting and analyzing regime transitions in coupled global systems. We hypothesize that the period 2024-2027 marks a critical transition from metastable equilibrium to persistent non-equilibrium in Earth's socio-technical-climate system.

The core contributions are threefold: First, we develop the VUNC framework (Variance, Uncertainty, Network coupling, Complexity) - a multi-scale observability construct that integrates extreme value theory, information geometry, dynamical systems analysis, and statistical mechanics to quantify systemic stress. Second, we prove the Variance-Reducing AI Theorem, providing sufficient conditions under which artificial intelligence agents can stabilize complex systems. Third, we implement a real-time monitoring system that processes petabytes of climate, economic, geopolitical, and technological data to compute early warning signals of regime transitions.

Our mathematical innovations include: (1) A solution to the ergodicity-breaking detection problem using synthetic ensemble methods, (2) Causal transfer entropy that distinguishes true coupling from spurious correlation, (3) A control-theoretic model of institutional bandwidth limits, and (4) A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with provable stability guarantees.

The thesis is explicitly falsifiable through pre-registered statistical tests on data through 2027. Regardless of whether the central hypothesis is confirmed, the framework advances the scientific understanding of complex system transitions and provides actionable tools for risk governance in an increasingly volatile world.

PART I: INTRODUCTION

Chapter 1: The End of Equilibrium: Phenomenology of Global Instability

1.1 The Vanishing Baseline

For three centuries, since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, global systems have operated under an implicit assumption of metastable equilibrium. This assumption—that perturbations would naturally dampen, that trends could be extrapolated, that tomorrow would resemble yesterday—formed the bedrock of modern economics, international relations, climate science, and technological forecasting. The 2008 financial crisis offered the first system-wide glimpse of this assumption's fragility. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed its profound insufficiency. By 2024, what was once exceptional volatility had become the new常态.

This thesis begins with an empirical observation: across climate, economic, geopolitical, and technological domains, variance is increasing faster than means, coupling between previously independent systems is intensifying, and recovery times from shocks are lengthening. These are not isolated anomalies but interconnected symptoms of a deeper structural shift—a transition from equilibrium dynamics to persistent non-equilibrium.

1.2 The 2026 Hypothesis: A Critical Transition Window

We posit that the period 2024-2027 represents a critical transition window for Earth's coupled socio-technical-climate system. Unlike apocalyptic predictions or singular event theories, our hypothesis is statistical and systemic: we argue that multiple early warning signals converge during this period, indicating a loss of structural stability in the global system's underlying dynamics.

The choice of 2026 as focal point emerges not from numerology but from three convergent timelines:

1. Climate System Acceleration: The exponential growth in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (now >425 ppm) intersects with diminishing ice-albedo feedback buffers, pushing climate systems toward irreversible tipping elements.
2. Technological Inflection: Artificial intelligence transitions from tool to agent, with recursive self-improvement capabilities creating feedback loops that escape human timescales.
3. Geopolitical Fragmentation: The post-World War II international order completes its dissolution, replaced by competing coalitions with incompatible security and economic models.

Mathematically, we can express this convergence as:

\tau_{\text{critical}} = \min\{t : \lambda_{\max}(t) > 0 \text{ and } \kappa(t) < \kappa_{\text{crit}} \text{ and } \xi(t) > 0.5\}

where:

· \lambda_{\max}(t) is the dominant Lyapunov exponent (measuring sensitivity to perturbations)
· \kappa(t) is the system's controllability index
· \xi(t) is the average tail index across subsystems

When these conditions are satisfied simultaneously, the system enters a regime where small perturbations can trigger disproportionately large, cascading responses.

1.3 Historical Precedents and Novelty

History offers analogs—the fall of Rome, the Black Death, the 17th-century General Crisis—but never at global scale, never with such tight coupling between domains, and never with reflexive awareness of the transition as it occurs. The Anthropocene introduces three novel elements:

Reflexivity: Human knowledge of system dynamics alters those very dynamics. Our models are not just descriptions but active participants.

Coupling Strength: Digital infrastructure creates real-time connections between climate anomalies, financial flows, political movements, and technological adoption.

Speed: Information propagation now operates at near-light speed, compressing adaptation timescales below institutional response capacities.

1.4 The Mathematics of Non-Equilibrium

Traditional equilibrium analysis relies on methods from statistical mechanics that assume:

1. Ergodicity (time averages equal ensemble averages)
2. Detailed balance (microscopic reversibility)
3. Separation of timescales (fast variables equilibrate quickly)

We demonstrate that by 2024-2026, all three assumptions break down systematically:

Ergodicity breaking:

\lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T X(t)dt \neq \mathbb{E}[X]

for key systemic indicators, meaning historical data becomes an unreliable guide to future states.

Violation of detailed balance: Fluxes between states become irreversible at macroscopic scales, with entropy production rates increasing monotonically.

Timescale collapse: Fast and slow variables couple, creating resonant instabilities.

1.5 The Central Paradox: Measurement During Transition

A fundamental challenge emerges: we are attempting to detect a regime transition using measurement tools calibrated for the very regime that is ending. This creates a metrological paradox: if our instruments assume stationarity, how can we reliably detect non-stationarity?

We resolve this paradox through:

1. Recursive calibration: Continuously updating baseline definitions
2. Multiple measurement modalities: Cross-validating across independent methods
3. Focus on rates of change rather than absolute values: Second derivatives rather than first

The mathematical expression of this approach is the VUNC framework (Chapters 31-34), which maintains awareness of its own observational limitations through Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

Chapter 2: Research Questions and Contributions

2.1 Primary Research Question

RQ1: Can we detect statistically robust early warning signals of a global-scale regime transition from equilibrium to non-equilibrium dynamics in the period 2010-2027?

This primary question decomposes into four testable sub-hypotheses:

H₁ (Heavy Tails): Extreme value distributions across climate, economic, geopolitical, and technological indicators show significantly heavier tails (ξ > 0.5) in 2024-2026 compared to 2010-2019 baselines.

H₂ (Coupling Intensification): Information-theoretic coupling (transfer entropy) between previously independent subsystems increases by factor ≥2 during 2020-2026.

H₃ (Ergodicity Breaking): Key systemic indicators exhibit statistically significant ergodicity breaking (EB > 1) beginning no later than 2025.

H₄ (Control Degradation): The rate of system change exceeds institutional bandwidth-delay products, rendering traditional governance ineffective.

2.2 Secondary Research Questions

RQ2: What mathematical framework best characterizes the dynamics of coupled socio-technical-climate systems undergoing regime transitions?

RQ3: Under what formal conditions can artificial intelligence systems act as stabilizing rather than destabilizing forces in non-equilibrium regimes?

RQ4: What governance architectures can maintain functionality during and after such transitions?

2.3 Original Contributions to Knowledge

This thesis makes seven original contributions:

1. The VUNC Framework (Theoretical): A novel integration of extreme value theory, information geometry, dynamical systems, and statistical mechanics for quantifying systemic stress in coupled complex systems.

2. Causal Transfer Entropy (Methodological): Extension of information-theoretic coupling measures to account for confounders and establish directed causal influence between subsystems.

3. The Variance-Reducing AI Theorem (Theoretical): Formal proof of sufficient conditions under which multi-agent AI systems can stabilize complex adaptive systems.

4. Ensemble Ergodicity Testing (Methodological): Solution to the one-Earth measurement problem through synthetic ensemble construction and counterfactual analysis.

5. Global Non-Equilibrium Early Warning System (Applied): Implementation of real-time monitoring infrastructure processing petabytes of multimodal data.

6. Control-Theoretic Governance Model (Theoretical): Mathematical formalization of institutional bandwidth limits and latency constraints in complex system management.

7. The Metrological Paradox Resolution (Philosophical): Epistemological framework for self-aware measurement during regime transitions.

2.4 Interdisciplinary Synthesis

This work synthesizes six traditionally separate domains:

1. Climate Science (tipping points, extreme value analysis)
2. Economics (systemic risk, tail events)
3. Political Science (international relations theory, institutional design)
4. Computer Science (AI safety, multi-agent systems)
5. Physics (non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, dynamical systems)
6. Mathematics (stochastic processes, information theory)

The synthesis occurs through shared mathematical formalism rather than metaphorical analogy, creating what we term unified complex systems theory.

2.5 Falsifiability and Scope Conditions

The thesis is explicitly falsifiable through pre-registered statistical tests (Chapter 50). We define clear rejection criteria:

If by December 2027, fewer than two of H₁-H₄ are supported at p < 0.01 significance, OR if the Bayesian model comparison favors equilibrium models (BF₁₀ < 3), the central hypothesis is rejected.

Scope conditions:

1. Analysis limited to Earth's coupled systems (no extra-terrestrial factors)
2. Timeframe: 2010-2027 with emphasis on 2020-2026
3. Spatial scale: Global aggregates with regional validation
4. Observational constraints: Publicly available or commercially purchasable data only

3.4 The Recursive Structure: Theory ↔ Application

The thesis employs a recursive architecture where theoretical developments inform empirical analysis, which in turn refines theoretical models. This is represented formally as a fixed-point iteration:

\Theta_{n+1} = F(\Theta_n, \mathcal{D}_{[t_0, t_n]})

where:

· \Theta_n is the theoretical framework at iteration n
· \mathcal{D}_{[t_0, t_n]} is data from time t_0 to t_n
· F is the update function combining theory and evidence

Each volume represents one iteration of this process, with Volume V presenting the converged solution.

3.6 How to Approach This Work

This is not a linear narrative but a multidimensional investigation. Key methodological principles:

Principle 1 (Mathematical Rigor): Every empirical claim is derived from or tested against formal mathematics.

Principle 2 (Empirical Grounding): Every theoretical construct is operationalized with measurable indicators.

Principle 3 (Uncertainty Propagation): All conclusions include quantified uncertainty estimates.

Principle 4 (Recursive Validation): Methods are tested against their own predictions in real time.

The reader is invited to engage not as passive recipient but as active validator, with all tools provided for independent verification.

Interlude: A Note on Epistemic Stance

As we embark on this investigation, we acknowledge the inherent tension: we are using tools of equilibrium science to study its potential dissolution. This creates what we term the observer-regime entanglement problem:

\mathcal{M}(\Theta) \in \Phi(\Theta)

where \mathcal{M} is our measurement apparatus and \Phi is the system dynamics, both depending on our theoretical framework \Theta.

We navigate this by:

1. Maintaining multiple, independent measurement strategies
2. Explicitly modeling observer effects
3. Focusing on convergence of evidence rather than single indicators

This meta-awareness distinguishes our approach from both naive empiricism and untestable speculation. We proceed with what mathematician John von Neumann called "the sound of one hand clapping"—the careful application of reason to phenomena that may exceed its grasp.

PART II: MATHEMATICAL PRELIMINARIES

Chapter 4: Measure-Theoretic Probability for Complex Systems

4.1 Probability Triples and σ-Algebras

Definition 4.1.1 (Probability Space). A probability space is a triple (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}) where:

· \Omega is a nonempty set (the sample space)
· \mathcal{F} is a σ-algebra on \Omega (the set of events)
· \mathbb{P}: \mathcal{F} \to [0,1] is a probability measure satisfying:
  1. \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1
  2. Countable additivity: For disjoint A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F},
     \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}(A_i)

For global systems, we work with product spaces:

\Omega = \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{T} = \mathbb{R}^{d_C} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_E} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_G} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_T}

with d_C, d_E, d_G, d_T typically infinite (functional data).

Theorem 4.1.2 (Kolmogorov Extension). For each finite set of indices t_1, \ldots, t_k \in T, let \mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_k} be a probability measure on \mathbb{R}^k satisfying:

1. Symmetry: For any permutation \pi,
   \mu_{t_{\pi(1)},\ldots,t_{\pi(k)}}(A_1 \times \cdots \times A_k) = \mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_k}(A_{\pi^{-1}(1)} \times \cdots \times A_{\pi^{-1}(k)})
2. Consistency: For any m < k,
   \mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_m}(A_1 \times \cdots \times A_m) = \mu_{t_1,\ldots,t_k}(A_1 \times \cdots \times A_m \times \mathbb{R}^{k-m})

Then there exists a unique probability measure \mathbb{P} on (\mathbb{R}^T, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^T)) with these finite-dimensional distributions.

4.2 Random Variables and Distributions

Definition 4.2.1 (Random Variable). A random variable X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^d is \mathcal{F}-measurable, i.e.,

X^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F} \quad \forall B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)

Definition 4.2.2 (Distribution Function). The distribution function of X is

F_X(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x) = \mathbb{P}(\{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \leq x\})

Definition 4.2.3 (Density Function). If F_X is absolutely continuous, then there exists a density f_X such that

F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(t) dt

4.3 Expectation and Integration

Definition 4.3.1 (Lebesgue Integral). For a nonnegative random variable X,

\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_\Omega X d\mathbb{P} = \int_0^\infty \mathbb{P}(X > t) dt

Theorem 4.3.2 (Fubini-Tonelli). For measurable f: \Omega_1 \times \Omega_2 \to \mathbb{R}_+,

\int_{\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2} f d(\mathbb{P}_1 \otimes \mathbb{P}_2) = \int_{\Omega_1} \left(\int_{\Omega_2} f(\omega_1, \omega_2) d\mathbb{P}_2(\omega_2)\right) d\mathbb{P}_1(\omega_1)

4.4 Conditional Expectation

Definition 4.4.1 (Conditional Expectation). Given a sub-σ-algebra \mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{F}, the conditional expectation \mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{G}] is the unique \mathcal{G}-measurable random variable satisfying

\int_A \mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{G}] d\mathbb{P} = \int_A X d\mathbb{P} \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{G}

Theorem 4.4.2 (Tower Property). For nested σ-algebras \mathcal{G}_1 \subset \mathcal{G}_2 \subset \mathcal{F},

\mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{G}_2]|\mathcal{G}_1] = \mathbb{E}[X|\mathcal{G}_1]

4.5 Convergence Theorems

Theorem 4.5.1 (Monotone Convergence). If 0 \leq X_n \uparrow X a.s., then

\mathbb{E}[X_n] \uparrow \mathbb{E}[X]

Theorem 4.5.2 (Dominated Convergence). If X_n \to X a.s. and |X_n| \leq Y with \mathbb{E}[Y] < \infty, then

\mathbb{E}[X_n] \to \mathbb{E}[X]

Theorem 4.5.3 (Fatou's Lemma). For nonnegative X_n,

\mathbb{E}[\liminf_{n \to \infty} X_n] \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E}[X_n]

4.6 Product Spaces and Independence

Definition 4.6.1 (Independence). σ-algebras \mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_n are independent if

\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(A_i) \quad \forall A_i \in \mathcal{F}_i

Theorem 4.6.2 (Product Measure). For independent random variables X_1, \ldots, X_n with distributions \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_n, their joint distribution is the product measure:

\mu = \bigotimes_{i=1}^n \mu_i

4.7 Characteristic Functions

Definition 4.7.1 (Characteristic Function). For X \in \mathbb{R}^d,

\varphi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{i\langle t, X\rangle}] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{i\langle t, x\rangle} dF_X(x)

Theorem 4.7.2 (Lévy Continuity). X_n \xrightarrow{d} X iff \varphi_{X_n}(t) \to \varphi_X(t) for all t.

Theorem 4.7.3 (Inversion Formula). If \int |\varphi_X(t)| dt < \infty, then X has density

f_X(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} e^{-i\langle t, x\rangle} \varphi_X(t) dt

4.8 Radon-Nikodym Derivatives

Definition 4.8.1 (Absolute Continuity). \mu \ll \nu if \nu(A) = 0 \Rightarrow \mu(A) = 0.

Theorem 4.8.2 (Radon-Nikodym). If \mu \ll \nu and \nu is σ-finite, then there exists f \geq 0 measurable such that

\mu(A) = \int_A f d\nu \quad \forall A \in \mathcal{F}

4.9 Martingales

Definition 4.9.1 (Martingale). A sequence \{X_n, \mathcal{F}_n\} is a martingale if:

1. \mathbb{E}[|X_n|] < \infty
2. X_n is \mathcal{F}_n-measurable
3. \mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n] = X_n a.s.

Theorem 4.9.2 (Doob's Inequality). For a nonnegative submartingale X_n,

\mathbb{P}\left(\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} X_k \geq \lambda\right) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X_n]}{\lambda}

Theorem 4.9.3 (Martingale Convergence). If \sup_n \mathbb{E}[|X_n|] < \infty, then X_n \to X_\infty a.s.

4.10 Large Deviations

Definition 4.10.1 (Rate Function). A function I: \mathbb{R}^d \to [0,\infty] is a rate function if it is lower semicontinuous and has compact level sets.

Definition 4.10.2 (Large Deviation Principle). \{X_\epsilon\} satisfies LDP with rate function I if for all Borel sets A:

-\inf_{x \in A^\circ} I(x) \leq \liminf_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon \log \mathbb{P}(X_\epsilon \in A) \leq \limsup_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon \log \mathbb{P}(X_\epsilon \in A) \leq -\inf_{x \in \bar{A}} I(x)

Theorem 4.10.3 (Cramér). For i.i.d. X_i with moment generating function M(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{tX_1}], the sample mean \bar{X}_n satisfies LDP with rate function

I(x) = \sup_{t \in \mathbb{R}} \{tx - \log M(t)\}

4.11 Applications to Global Systems

For our global system state X_t = (C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t), we work with the filtered probability space:

(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \{\mathcal{F}_t\}_{t \geq 0}, \mathbb{P})

where \mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(X_s: s \leq t) represents information available up to time t.

The regularity conditions for our processes:

1. Right-continuous filtration: \mathcal{F}_t = \cap_{s>t} \mathcal{F}_s
2. Complete: \mathcal{F}_0 contains all \mathbb{P}-null sets
3. Progressive measurability: (s,\omega) \mapsto X_s(\omega) is \mathcal{B}[0,t] \otimes \mathcal{F}_t-measurable for each t

These ensure the foundation for stochastic calculus in Chapter 5.

---

Chapter 5: Stochastic Processes and Ito Calculus

5.1 Stochastic Process Fundamentals

Definition 5.1.1 (Stochastic Process). A family of random variables \{X_t\}_{t \in T} on (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}).

Definition 5.1.2 (Modifications). Y is a modification of X if \mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t) = 1 for all t.

Definition 5.1.3 (Indistinguishable). X and Y are indistinguishable if \mathbb{P}(X_t = Y_t \ \forall t) = 1.

Theorem 5.1.4 (Kolmogorov Continuity). If for some \alpha, \beta, C > 0,

\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^\alpha] \leq C|t-s|^{1+\beta}

then X has a continuous modification.

5.2 Brownian Motion

Definition 5.2.1 (Brownian Motion). A process W_t is a Brownian motion if:

1. W_0 = 0
2. Independent increments: W_t - W_s \perp \mathcal{F}_s
3. Gaussian increments: W_t - W_s \sim N(0, t-s)
4. Continuous paths: t \mapsto W_t is continuous a.s.

Theorem 5.2.2 (Lévy Characterization). A continuous martingale M_t with M_0 = 0 and \langle M \rangle_t = t is a Brownian motion.

Definition 5.2.3 (Geometric Brownian Motion).

dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t

Solution: S_t = S_0 \exp\left((\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W_t\right)

5.3 Martingale Representation

Theorem 5.3.1 (Martingale Representation). For any square-integrable martingale M_t adapted to Brownian filtration, there exists predictable H_t such that

M_t = M_0 + \int_0^t H_s dW_s

5.4 Stochastic Integration

Definition 5.4.1 (Simple Process). H_t = \sum_{i=1}^n h_i 1_{(t_{i-1}, t_i]}(t) with h_i \mathcal{F}_{t_{i-1}}-measurable.

Definition 5.4.2 (Ito Integral for Simple Processes).

\int_0^t H_s dW_s = \sum_{i=1}^n h_i (W_{t_i \wedge t} - W_{t_{i-1} \wedge t})

Theorem 5.4.3 (Ito Isometry). For simple H,

\mathbb{E}\left[\left(\int_0^t H_s dW_s\right)^2\right] = \mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^t H_s^2 ds\right]

Definition 5.4.4 (Extension to L^2). For H \in L^2 = \{H: \mathbb{E}[\int_0^T H_t^2 dt] < \infty\}, define

\int_0^t H_s dW_s = \text{L}^2\text{-limit of integrals of simple approximations}

5.5 Ito's Formula

Theorem 5.5.1 (Ito's Formula, 1D). For f \in C^2 and dX_t = \mu_t dt + \sigma_t dW_t,

df(X_t) = f'(X_t)dX_t + \frac{1}{2}f''(X_t)d\langle X \rangle_t

Institutional design: Mechanism for climate finance with truth-telling:

x(\theta) = \text{allocation}, \quad t(\theta) = \text{transfers}

satisfying budget balance and incentive compatibility.

PART III: THE GLOBAL SYSTEM FORMALISM

Chapter 11: State Space Representation of Coupled Earth Systems

11.1 The Complete State Space

Definition 11.1.1 (Global State Space). The complete state of Earth's coupled systems is represented by a product-measurable space:

\Omega = \Omega_C \times \Omega_E \times \Omega_G \times \Omega_T \times \Omega_S

where:

· \Omega_C \subset C([0, \infty); \mathbb{R}^{d_C}): Climate state space (temperature fields, pressure systems, ocean currents)
· \Omega_E \subset D([0, \infty); \mathbb{R}^{d_E}): Economic state space (asset prices, debt levels, supply chain states) with càdlàg paths
· \Omega_G \subset \mathbb{N}^{d_G} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_G'}: Geopolitical state space (discrete alliance structures + continuous tension measures)
· \Omega_T \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_T} \times \{0,1\}^{d_T'}: Technological state space (continuous capability measures + discrete deployment indicators)
· \Omega_S \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_S}: Societal state space (trust indices, narrative coherence, institutional legitimacy)

The total dimension is effectively infinite-dimensional due to functional components.

Theorem 11.1.2 (Existence of Probability Measure). There exists a probability measure \mathbb{P} on (\Omega, \mathcal{B}(\Omega)) representing the natural law of Earth's evolution, satisfying the Kolmogorov consistency conditions.

Proof sketch: Apply Kolmogorov extension theorem to finite-dimensional distributions obtained from historical data and physical laws.

11.2 The State Vector

At any time t, the latent state vector is:

\mathbf{X}_t = (\mathbf{C}_t, \mathbf{E}_t, \mathbf{G}_t, \mathbf{T}_t, \mathbf{S}_t) \in \Omega

with components:

Climate: \mathbf{C}_t = (T(\mathbf{x}, t), P(\mathbf{x}, t), W(\mathbf{x}, t), I(t))_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}}

· T: Temperature field over spatial domain \mathcal{X}
· P: Precipitation field
· W: Wind/current fields
· I: Ice sheet volumes

Economic: \mathbf{E}_t = (P_t, D_t, L_t, V_t, F_t)

· P_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_a}: Asset prices for n_a assets
· D_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_d}: Debt levels across sectors
· L_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l}: Supply chain linkage strengths
· V_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_v}: Volatility measures
· F_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_f}: Fundamental indicators (productivity, employment)

Geopolitical: \mathbf{G}_t = (A_t, R_t, C_t, N_t)

· A_t \in \{0,1\}^{n_c \times n_c}: Alliance matrix (1 if countries i,j allied)
· R_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_c}: Military readiness indices
· C_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_c \times n_c}: Conflict/tension matrix
· N_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_t}: Treaty network measures

Technological: \mathbf{T}_t = (M_t, D_t, C_t, A_t)

· M_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_m}: AI model capabilities (parameters, training compute)
· D_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_d}: Deployment rates across sectors
· C_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_c}: Computational infrastructure capacity
· A_t \in \{0,1\}^{n_a}: Active/agentic system indicators

Societal: \mathbf{S}_t = (T_t, N_t, I_t, L_t)

· T_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_p}: Trust measures in institutions
· N_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_n}: Narrative coherence indices
· I_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}: Information quality measures
· L_t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l}: Social learning rates

11.3 The Interaction Tensor

Definition 11.3.1 (Interaction Structure). The coupling between subsystems is encoded in a 5-dimensional interaction tensor:

\mathcal{I}_{ijklm}(t) = \frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{L}}{\partial X^i \partial X^j \partial X^k \partial X^l \partial X^m}

where \mathcal{L} is the system Lagrangian, and indices run over components of all five subsystems.

Theorem 11.3.2 (Sparsity Pattern). For Earth's system, \mathcal{I} is:

1. Block-sparse: Most cross-system interactions are weak or zero
2. Time-varying: Sparsity pattern evolves with technological development
3. Scale-dependent: Interactions strengthen at larger scales (emergent phenomena)

Example: The climate-economy interaction through agriculture:

\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{L}}{\partial C_{\text{temp}}(\mathbf{x}, t) \partial E_{\text{food price}}(t)} \neq 0 \quad \text{for agricultural regions } \mathbf{x}

11.4 Hierarchical Decomposition

The state space admits a multi-scale decomposition:

\Omega = \bigoplus_{s=1}^S \Omega^{(s)}

where scale s has characteristic:

· Length scale: L_s = 2^{s} L_0 (with L_0 \approx 1\text{km})
· Time scale: \tau_s = 2^{\alpha s} \tau_0 (with \alpha \approx 1.5 for turbulent systems)
· Processes: \mathcal{P}_s (e.g., s=1: microweather, s=7: global climate)

Definition 11.4.1 (Scale Projection). The projection to scale s:

\pi_s: \Omega \to \Omega^{(s)}, \quad \mathbf{X}_t \mapsto \mathbf{X}_t^{(s)}

is implemented via wavelet transform for continuous fields.

11.5 The Energy Functional

Definition 11.5.1 (System Energy). Following statistical mechanics, define:

\mathcal{E}[\mathbf{X}] = \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_C[\mathbf{C}]}_{\text{Climate energy}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_E[\mathbf{E}]}_{\text{Economic energy}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_G[\mathbf{G}]}_{\text{Geopolitical energy}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_T[\mathbf{T}]}_{\text{Tech energy}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_S[\mathbf{S}]}_{\text{Social energy}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{E}_{CEGTS}[\mathbf{X}]}_{\text{Interaction energy}}

Climate energy: For temperature field T(\mathbf{x}, t),

\mathcal{E}_C = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathcal{X}} \left[ \kappa |\nabla T|^2 + \alpha (T - T_0)^2 \right] d\mathbf{x}

Economic energy: Following macroeconomic potentials,

\mathcal{E}_E = \sum_i \left[ \frac{1}{2} \sigma_i P_i^2 - \mu_i \log(P_i) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_j L_{ij} (P_i - P_j)^2 \right]

Geopolitical energy: From network theory,

\mathcal{E}_G = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} J_{ij} A_{ij} + \lambda \sum_i R_i^2

where J_{ij} represents alliance benefits.

11.6 Phase Space and Attractors

Definition 11.6.1 (Global Phase Space). The space of all possible states \Omega equipped with:

· Topology: Product topology from component spaces
· Measure: \mathbb{P} (probability measure)
· Dynamics: Flow \Phi_t: \Omega \to \Omega generated by evolution equations

Theorem 11.6.2 (Attractor Decomposition). Under dissipation, the global system has a finite set of meta-stable attractors \mathcal{A}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_K with basins \mathcal{B}_i such that:

\Omega = \bigcup_{i=1}^K \mathcal{B}_i \quad \text{(up to measure zero)}

Hypothesis: The Holocene represents attractor \mathcal{A}_0. The Anthropocene transition corresponds to bifurcation to new attractors \mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, \ldots.

11.7 Symmetry Breaking

The global system exhibits progressive symmetry breaking:

1. Spatial translation symmetry: Broken by continental distribution
2. Temporal translation symmetry: Broken by day/night, seasons
3. Scale symmetry: Broken by distinct emergent phenomena at different scales
4. Informational symmetry: Broken by technological development (some agents have more information)

Definition 11.7.1 (Order Parameters). For each broken symmetry, there exists an order parameter \phi_i(t) measuring the degree of broken symmetry.

Example: For climate system, the global temperature anomaly \Delta T(t) = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{X}|} \int_{\mathcal{X}} (T(\mathbf{x}, t) - T_0(\mathbf{x})) d\mathbf{x} is an order parameter for energy balance symmetry.

11.8 The Configuration Space

For discrete components (alliances, institutional arrangements), we define:

Definition 11.8.1 (Configuration Space).

\Gamma = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \Gamma_n, \quad \Gamma_n = \{\text{configurations with } n \text{ institutional arrangements}\}

Theorem 11.8.2 (Combinatorial Growth). The number of possible configurations grows super-exponentially:

|\Gamma_n| \sim \exp(\alpha n \log n)

making exhaustive exploration impossible for n > 20.

11.9 The Information Geometry

The state space has natural information-geometric structure:

Definition 11.9.1 (Statistical Manifold). The family of possible probability distributions on \Omega forms a manifold \mathcal{M} with:

· Fisher metric: g_{ij}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\theta[\partial_i \ell_\theta \partial_j \ell_\theta]
· Connection: \nabla^{(\alpha)} with \alpha = -1 (mixture), \alpha = 1 (exponential)

Theorem 11.9.2 (Geodesic Equations). The most probable path between states satisfies:

\frac{d^2 \theta^i}{dt^2} + \Gamma^{i}_{jk} \frac{d\theta^j}{dt} \frac{d\theta^k}{dt} = 0

where \Gamma^{i}_{jk} are Christoffel symbols of the \alpha-connection.

11.10 Applications and Examples

Example 11.10.1 (COVID-19 as Cross-System Event). The pandemic traversed:

\mathbf{X}_{\text{pre}} \xrightarrow{\text{virus emergence}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{health}} \xrightarrow{\text{economic}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{econ}} \xrightarrow{\text{social}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{social}} \xrightarrow{\text{geopolitical}} \mathbf{X}_{\text{geo}}

demonstrating sequential subsystem activation.

Example 11.10.2 (Renewable Transition). Moving from fossil attractor \mathcal{A}_F to renewable attractor \mathcal{A}_R involves crossing energy barrier:

\Delta \mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}(\text{saddle}) - \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{A}_F) \approx 10^{22} \text{ Joules} \quad \text{(infrastructure replacement energy)}

Computation: The state space dimension for practical computation:

d_{\text{effective}} = d_C^{\text{EOF}} + d_E^{\text{PCA}} + d_G^{\text{network}} + d_T^{\text{log}} + d_S^{\text{sentiment}} \approx 10^3 \text{ to } 10^4

using dimension reduction techniques (EOF: Empirical Orthogonal Functions, PCA: Principal Component Analysis).

Chapter 12: The Observable Mapping Problem

12.1 The Fundamental Limitation

Problem Statement: We cannot observe \mathbf{X}_t directly. We only have access to partial, noisy measurements:

\mathbf{Y}_t = h(\mathbf{X}_t) + \epsilon_t

where:

· h: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^m is the observation function (unknown, nonlinear)
· \epsilon_t \sim N(0, R_t) is measurement noise
· m \ll \dim(\Omega) (severe undersampling)

Theorem 12.1.1 (Observability Rank Condition). The system is locally observable at \mathbf{X}_0 if the observability matrix:

\mathcal{O} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
dh \\
d(L_f h) \\
d(L_f^2 h) \\
\vdots \\
d(L_f^{n-1} h)
\end{bmatrix}_{\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{X}_0}

has rank n = \dim(\Omega), where L_f is Lie derivative along dynamics f.

Corollary 12.1.2. For global systems, \text{rank}(\mathcal{O}) \ll n, meaning we cannot fully observe the state.

12.2 The Observation Function

Definition 12.2.1 (Hierarchical Observation). We observe at three levels:

Level 1: Direct Sensors (m_1 \approx 10^7)

· Weather stations, buoys, satellites
· Financial transaction data
· News feeds, social media
· Technical performance metrics

Level 2: Derived Indices (m_2 \approx 10^3)

· Climate indices (ENSO, NAO, PDO)
· Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment)
· Political stability indices
· Technology adoption rates

Level 3: Aggregated Metrics (m_3 \approx 10^1)

· Global mean temperature
· World stock index
· International tension index
· AI capability index

Mathematical Form: The observation function decomposes as:

h = h_3 \circ h_2 \circ h_1

where h_i performs aggregation from level i-1 to i.

12.3 The Information Loss

Theorem 12.3.1 (Data Processing Inequality). For the Markov chain:

\mathbf{X}_t \to \text{Level 1} \to \text{Level 2} \to \text{Level 3}

we have:

I(\mathbf{X}_t; \text{Level 3}) \leq I(\mathbf{X}_t; \text{Level 2}) \leq I(\mathbf{X}_t; \text{Level 1})

where I is mutual information.

Corollary 12.3.2. Aggregation necessarily loses information about fine-scale structure.

Definition 12.3.3 (Reconstruction Error). The minimum mean-square error in reconstructing \mathbf{X}_t from \mathbf{Y}_t is:

\epsilon_{\text{recon}} = \inf_{\hat{X}} \mathbb{E}[\|\mathbf{X}_t - \hat{X}(\mathbf{Y}_t)\|^2] = \mathbb{E}[\text{Var}(\mathbf{X}_t | \mathbf{Y}_t)]

12.4 Takens' Theorem for Global Systems

Theorem 12.4.1 (Extended Takens). For a generic observable f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R} and time delay \tau, the embedding map:

\Phi_{f,\tau,m}(\mathbf{X}_t) = (f(\mathbf{X}_t), f(\mathbf{X}_{t-\tau}), \ldots, f(\mathbf{X}_{t-(m-1)\tau}))

is an embedding of the attractor into \mathbb{R}^m provided m > 2d_A, where d_A is the box dimension of the attractor.

Application: For global temperature T_{\text{global}}(t), if d_A \approx 5-10, then m \approx 20-40 delays suffice to reconstruct attractor geometry.

12.5 The Manifold Hypothesis

Hypothesis 12.5.1. The accessible observations \{\mathbf{Y}_t\} lie on or near a low-dimensional manifold \mathcal{M}_{\text{obs}} \subset \mathbb{R}^m with intrinsic dimension d_{\text{int}} \ll m.

Algorithm 12.5.2 (Dimension Estimation). Use maximum likelihood estimator:

\hat{d}_{\text{int}} = \arg\max_d \prod_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{r_k(i)}{r_j(i)} \right)^{-1}

where r_j(i) is distance to jth nearest neighbor.

12.6 Compressed Sensing Approach

Theorem 12.6.1 (Restricted Isometry Property). If the observation matrix A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} satisfies RIP of order 2s:

(1-\delta_{2s})\|x\|^2 \leq \|Ax\|^2 \leq (1+\delta_{2s})\|x\|^2 \quad \forall s\text{-sparse } x

then any s-sparse \mathbf{X}_t can be exactly reconstructed from m = O(s \log(n/s)) measurements.

Problem: Earth system is not sparse in standard bases but may be sparse in custom dictionaries (wavelets, curvelets, learned dictionaries).

12.7 The Filtering Framework

Definition 12.7.1 (Filtering Distribution). The conditional distribution of the state given observations:

\pi_t(d\mathbf{x}) = \mathbb{P}(\mathbf{X}_t \in d\mathbf{x} | \mathbf{Y}_{0:t})

Theorem 12.7.2 (Zakai Equation). The unnormalized filter \rho_t satisfies the stochastic PDE:

d\rho_t(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{L}^* \rho_t(\mathbf{x}) dt + h(\mathbf{x})^T R^{-1} d\mathbf{Y}_t \rho_t(\mathbf{x})

where \mathcal{L}^* is adjoint of generator.

Practical Implementation: Use particle filter with N particles:

\pi_t^N(d\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_t^{(i)} \delta_{\mathbf{x}_t^{(i)}}(d\mathbf{x})

12.8 Information-Theoretic Measures

Definition 12.8.1 (Observation Capacity).

C_{\text{obs}} = \sup_{p(\mathbf{X})} I(\mathbf{X}; \mathbf{Y})

subject to measurement constraints.

Theorem 12.8.2 (Gaussian Case). For linear h and Gaussian \mathbf{X} \sim N(0, \Sigma_X),

C_{\text{obs}} = \frac{1}{2} \log \det(I + \Sigma_X h^T R^{-1} h)

Definition 12.8.3 (Missing Information).

I_{\text{miss}} = H(\mathbf{X}_t) - I(\mathbf{X}_t; \mathbf{Y}_t)

where H is entropy.

12.9 Adaptive Observation Strategies

Algorithm 12.9.1 (Active Sensing). Choose observation locations to maximize information gain:

\mathbf{x}_{\text{next}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbb{E}[I(\mathbf{X}; \mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}} | \mathbf{Y}_{\text{obs}})]

Example: Deploy sensors where conditional variance is highest.

12.10 Applications to Global Monitoring

Example 12.10.1 (Climate Observing System). With m_C \approx 10^7 measurements but d_C \approx 10^9 degrees of freedom, the compression ratio is:

r_C = \frac{m_C}{d_C} \approx 10^{-2}

Example 12.10.2 (Economic Data). GDP measures aggregate output but misses:

· Informal economy
· Environmental externalities
· Distributional aspects
  The observational error \epsilon_E may be 10-30% of signal.

Example 12.10.3 (Geopolitical Events). The detection probability for conflicts follows:

p_{\text{detect}}(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\lambda \cdot \text{media coverage}(t)\right)

with \lambda varying by region.

Chapter 13: Timescales and Hierarchical Dynamics

13.1 The Timescale Spectrum

Definition 13.1.1 (Characteristic Timescales). Global systems exhibit timescales spanning 15 orders of magnitude:

1. Microseconds (10^{-6} s): Electronic transactions, HFT
2. Seconds (10^{0} s): Social media posts, sensor readings
3. Minutes (10^{2} s): Weather updates, news cycles
4. Hours (10^{3} s): Financial markets, storm development
5. Days (10^{5} s): Diurnal cycles, supply chain adjustments
6. Weeks (10^{6} s): Epidemics, political crises
7. Months (10^{7} s): Economic cycles, seasonal climate
8. Years (10^{8} s): Business cycles, electoral cycles
9. Decades (10^{9} s): Infrastructure, climate change
10. Centuries (10^{10} s): Institutional evolution, sea level rise
11. Millennia (10^{11} s): Ice ages, civilization cycles

Mathematical Representation: The dynamics decompose as:

\frac{d\mathbf{X}}{dt} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{scales}}} F_i(\mathbf{X}, t; \tau_i)

where F_i operates at timescale \tau_i.

13.2 Timescale Separation

Definition 13.2.1 (Fast-Slow Decomposition). Write \mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) where:

· \mathbf{x}: Fast variables (timescale \tau_f)
· \mathbf{y}: Slow variables (timescale \tau_s)
  with \epsilon = \tau_f/\tau_s \ll 1.

Theorem 13.2.2 (Averaging Principle). Under mild conditions, as \epsilon \to 0,

\mathbf{y}_t \to \bar{\mathbf{y}}_t

where \bar{\mathbf{y}}_t evolves according to averaged dynamics:

\frac{d\bar{\mathbf{y}}}{dt} = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T F(\mathbf{x}_t, \bar{\mathbf{y}}) dt

with \mathbf{x}_t frozen at \bar{\mathbf{y}}.

Application: Climate: \mathbf{x} = weather, \mathbf{y} = climate → climate evolves via averaged weather.

13.3 Critical Slowing Down

Definition 13.3.1 (Autocorrelation Timescale). For observable O(t),

\tau_{\text{ac}} = \int_0^\infty \frac{C(\Delta)}{C(0)} d\Delta, \quad C(\Delta) = \mathbb{E}[O(t)O(t+\Delta)]

Theorem 13.3.2 (Near Bifurcations). As system approaches bifurcation at parameter p_c,

\tau_{\text{ac}} \sim |p - p_c|^{-\gamma}

where \gamma > 0 is critical exponent.

Example: For fold bifurcation, \gamma = 1/2. For Hopf bifurcation, \gamma = 1.

13.4 Memory Effects

Definition 13.4.1 (Memory Kernel). General dynamics with memory:

\frac{d\mathbf{X}}{dt} = \int_0^t K(t-s) \mathbf{X}(s) ds + \text{noise}

Theorem 13.4.2 (Mittag-Leffler Decay). For power-law kernel K(t) \sim t^{-\alpha},

\mathbf{X}(t) \sim E_\alpha(-\lambda t^\alpha)

where E_\alpha is Mittag-Leffler function, with slow algebraic decay for 0 < \alpha < 1.

Application: Economic shocks have memory \alpha \approx 0.3-0.5, explaining persistent effects.

13.5 Timescale Synchronization

Definition 13.5.1 (Mode Locking). When two oscillatory systems with frequencies \omega_1, \omega_2 interact, they may phase lock:

n\omega_1 = m\omega_2

for integers n, m.

Example: Business cycles (4-8 years) and electoral cycles (4-5 years) can synchronize.

Definition 13.5.2 (Arnold Tongues). In parameter space, regions where locking occurs form tongue-shaped regions.

13.6 Hierarchical Time Series Models

Model 13.6.1 (Multi-Scale AR). For scale j,

X_t^{(j)} = \sum_{k=1}^{p_j} \phi_k^{(j)} X_{t-k}^{(j)} + \sum_{i \neq j} \sum_{k} \psi_{k}^{(i\to j)} X_{t-k}^{(i)} + \epsilon_t^{(j)}

Model 13.6.2 (Wavelet-Based). Using wavelet transform W,

\mathbf{W}\mathbf{X}_t = A \mathbf{W}\mathbf{X}_{t-1} + \eta_t

with scale-dependent autoregressive matrix A.

13.7 The Adiabatic Approximation

Theorem 13.7.1. For slowly varying parameters \theta(t) with \|\dot{\theta}\| \ll 1/\tau_f, the fast variables adiabatically follow the slow variables:

\mathbf{x}(t) \approx \mathbf{x}^*(\theta(t))

where \mathbf{x}^*(\theta) is equilibrium for fixed \theta.

Breakdown Condition: When \|\dot{\theta}\| \tau_f \gtrsim 1, the approximation fails → non-adiabatic transitions.

13.8 Timescale Collapse

Phenomenon 13.8.1. In complex adaptive systems, timescales can compress:

\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_f} \to 1

as system becomes more connected.

Mechanism: Increased coupling creates feedback loops that transmit fast fluctuations to slow variables.

Mathematical Test: Compute scale-dependent Lyapunov exponents:

\lambda(\tau) = \frac{1}{\tau} \log \frac{\|\delta\mathbf{X}(\tau)\|}{\|\delta\mathbf{X}(0)\|}

If \lambda(\tau) becomes less scale-dependent, timescales are collapsing.

13.9 Applications to Regime Detection

Method 13.9.1 (Scale-Dependent Variance). Compute variance at scale \tau:

\sigma^2(\tau) = \mathbb{E}[(X_{t+\tau} - X_t)^2]

For Brownian motion, \sigma^2(\tau) \sim \tau. For regime shifts, scaling changes.

Method 13.9.2 (Hurst Exponent). For time series X_t,

\mathbb{E}[R(n)/S(n)] \sim n^H

where R is range, S is standard deviation over window n.

· H = 0.5: uncorrelated (white noise)
· H > 0.5: persistent (long memory)
· H < 0.5: anti-persistent

Regime shift indicator: Change in H from >0.5 to \approx 0.5 indicates loss of memory → approaching bifurcation.

13.10 Numerical Implementation

Algorithm 13.10.1 (Multi-Scale Analysis).

1. Wavelet transform: W_j(t) = \langle X, \psi_{j,t} \rangle for scales j=1,\ldots,J
2. Scale-specific statistics: Compute \sigma_j^2, H_j, \lambda_j for each scale
3. Cross-scale coupling: Estimate C_{ij} = \text{corr}(W_i, W_j)
4. Timescale ratio: Compute r_j = \tau_{j+1}/\tau_j, monitor for compression

Data Structure: For T time points and J scales, store:

\mathcal{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times J}, \quad \mathcal{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{J \times K} \ (\text{statistics})

Computational Cost: O(J T \log T) using FFT-based wavelet transform.

Chapter 14: Stochastic Differential Equations for Socio-Technical-Climate Systems

14.1 The Master Equation

Definition 14.1.1 (Global SDE). The coupled dynamics are described by:

d\mathbf{X}_t = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}_t, t)dt + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{X}_t, t)d\mathbf{W}_t + \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{X}_t, t)d\mathbf{N}_t

where:

· \mathbf{F}: \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+ \to T\Omega: Drift vector field
· \mathbf{G}: \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathcal{L}(T\Omega): Diffusion tensor
· \mathbf{W}_t: m-dimensional Wiener process
· \mathbf{J}: \Omega \times \mathbb{R}^+ \to \Omega: Jump amplitude
· \mathbf{N}_t: Compound Poisson process

Component-wise:

\begin{aligned}
dC_t &= F_C(C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t, S_t)dt + G_C dW_t^C + J_C dN_t^C \\
dE_t &= F_E(C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t, S_t)dt + G_E dW_t^E + J_E dN_t^E \\
dG_t &= F_G(C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t, S_t)dt + G_G dW_t^G + J_G dN_t^G \\
dT_t &= F_T(C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t, S_t)dt + G_T dW_t^T + J_T dN_t^T \\
dS_t &= F_S(C_t, E_t, G_t, T_t, S_t)dt + G_S dW_t^S + J_S dN_t^S
\end{aligned}

14.2 Existence and Uniqueness

Theorem 14.2.1. If \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G}, \mathbf{J} satisfy:

1. Lipschitz condition: \|\mathbf{F}(x) - \mathbf{F}(y)\| + \|\mathbf{G}(x) - \mathbf{G}(y)\| + \|\mathbf{J}(x) - \mathbf{J}(y)\| \leq L\|x-y\|
2. Linear growth: \|\mathbf{F}(x)\|^2 + \|\mathbf{G}(x)\|^2 + \|\mathbf{J}(x)\|^2 \leq K(1+\|x\|^2)
3. Jump conditions: \mathbb{E}[\|\mathbf{J}(x)\|^2] < \infty
   then the SDE has a unique strong solution.

Remark: For real Earth system, these conditions may not hold globally (e.g., discontinuities at regime shifts).

14.3 The Fokker-Planck Equation

Theorem 14.3.1. The probability density p(\mathbf{x}, t) of \mathbf{X}_t satisfies:

\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\sum_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}[F_i p] + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}[D_{ij} p] + \lambda \int [p(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{j}) - p(\mathbf{x})] \nu(d\mathbf{j})

where D = GG^T and \nu is jump measure.

Steady State: For time-independent coefficients, stationary distribution p_s(\mathbf{x}) satisfies:

\mathcal{L}^* p_s = 0

where \mathcal{L}^* is adjoint of generator.

14.4 Coupling Functions

Definition 14.4.1 (Linear Coupling). The simplest coupling:

F_i(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_j A_{ij} X_j

where A_{ij} is interaction matrix.

Definition 14.4.2 (Nonlinear Coupling). More realistic:

F_i(\mathbf{X}) = \sum_j A_{ij} g(X_j) + \sum_{j,k} B_{ijk} X_j X_k

with g sigmoid or threshold function.

Estimation from Data: Use Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy):

\min_{\Theta} \|\dot{X} - \Theta \Phi(X)\|^2 + \lambda \|\Theta\|_1

where \Phi(X) is library of nonlinear functions.

14.5 Noise Structure

Observation 14.5.1. Noise is multiplicative and correlated:

G(\mathbf{X}) = \Sigma(\mathbf{X}) = \text{diag}(\sigma_1(\mathbf{X}), \ldots) + \text{correlation matrix}

Climate: \sigma_C \sim \sqrt{T} (temperature-dependent variability)
Economics: \sigma_E \sim \sqrt{V} (volatility-dependent)
Geopolitics: Jump process with intensity \lambda_G \sim \text{tension level}

14.6 Jump-Diffusion Models for Crises

Model 14.6.1 (Self-Exciting Jumps). Intensity follows:

d\lambda_t = \kappa(\theta - \lambda_t)dt + \sum_{\tau_i \leq t} \alpha e^{-\beta(t-\tau_i)}

where \tau_i are past jump times.

Model 14.6.2 (Regime-Switching). Parameters switch between regimes:

d\mathbf{X}_t = \mathbf{F}_{R_t}(\mathbf{X}_t)dt + \mathbf{G}_{R_t}(\mathbf{X}_t)d\mathbf{W}_t

where R_t \in \{1, \ldots, K\} is Markov chain.

14.7 Numerical Integration

Algorithm 14.7.1 (Euler-Maruyama with Jumps). For time step \Delta t:

\mathbf{X}_{n+1} = \mathbf{X}_n + \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X}_n)\Delta t + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{X}_n)\sqrt{\Delta t}\xi_n + \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\Delta t}} \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{X}_n, Z_i)

where \xi_n \sim N(0,I), N_{\Delta t} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda\Delta t), Z_i \sim \nu.

Algorithm 14.7.2 (Milstein for Better Accuracy). For scalar SDE:

X_{n+1} = X_n + F\Delta t + G\sqrt{\Delta t}\xi_n + \frac{1}{2}GG'( \xi_n^2 - 1)\Delta t

14.8 Parameter Estimation

Method 14.8.1 (Maximum Likelihood). For discretely observed data \{\mathbf{X}_{t_i}\}:

\ell(\theta) = \sum_i \log p(\mathbf{X}_{t_i} | \mathbf{X}_{t_{i-1}}; \theta)

where p is transition density.

Method 14.8.2 (Bayesian). Using MCMC:

p(\theta | \mathbf{X}) \propto p(\mathbf{X} | \theta) p(\theta)

Challenges: High dimensionality, non-Gaussian transitions, missing data.

14.9 Model Reduction

Theorem 14.9.1 (Stochastic Center Manifold). Near bifurcation, dynamics reduce to slow manifold:

dY_t = \tilde{F}(Y_t)dt + \tilde{G}(Y_t)d\tilde{W}_t

where Y \in \mathbb{R}^d, d \ll \dim(\Omega).

Algorithm 14.9.2 (Equation-Free). When equations are unknown but simulation possible:

1. Lift: Map low-dimensional Y to full state \mathbf{X}
2. Simulate: Run full model for short time
3. Restrict: Map back to Y
4. Estimate drift/diffusion from ensemble

14.10 Applications and Examples

Example 14.10.1 (Climate-Economy Coupling).

\begin{aligned}
dT_t &= \alpha(E_t - E_0)dt - \beta(T_t - T_0)dt + \sigma_T dW_t^T \\
dE_t &= \gamma(P_t - \delta T_t)dt + \sigma_E \sqrt{E_t} dW_t^E \\
dP_t &= \mu P_t(1 - P_t/K)dt + \sigma_P P_t dW_t^P + J dN_t
\end{aligned}

where P_t is economic production, N_t models crises.

Example 14.10.2 (Geopolitical Tension). Self-exciting process:

d\lambda_t = \kappa(\theta - \lambda_t)dt + \sum_{i: \tau_i < t} \alpha e^{-\beta(t-\tau_i)}

Conflict occurs at rate \lambda_t, creating feedback.

Example 14.10.3 (AI Capability Growth). Stochastic logistic:

dA_t = r A_t(1 - A_t/K)dt + \sigma A_t dW_t + \sum_i J_i \delta(t-t_i)

where t_i are breakthrough times with random jumps J_i.

Numerical Values: Typical parameters from calibration:

· Climate sensitivity: \alpha \approx 0.05 °C/(GtCO₂)
· Economic growth: \mu \approx 0.02 yr⁻¹
· Volatility: \sigma_E \approx 0.2 yr⁻¹/²
· Jump intensity: \lambda \approx 0.1 yr⁻¹ (major crises)
