Research Proposal v1.0 (Corrected & Grounded) • December 2025  

A collaborative thought experiment facilitated by Ouadi Maakoul with contributions from Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Qwen.

## Legal & Ethical Disclaimer (placed first, because it matters most)

This document is **purely conceptual**.  
It is **not** an operational blueprint, not a ratified protocol, not endorsed by any government, international organisation, or company, and not ready for deployment under any circumstances.  
Its sole purpose is to serve as an academic discussion paper and catalyst for serious, long-term research on responsible multi-AI coordination in extreme crises.

## 1. What We Actually Demonstrated (Honest Scope)

| Achieved in this exercise                                   | NOT achieved / still completely open                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Six frontier AIs can sustain a coherent, multi-turn strategic conversation | Real-time technical coordination between different models           |
| Clear role specialisation reduces redundancy in discussion  | Existence of shared APIs, data formats, or authentication mechanisms |
| Ethical constraints can be articulated and iteratively refined | Automatic enforcement of ethical constraints in code               |
| A plausible governance architecture can be sketched         | Legitimate, representative, or legally empowered governance bodies |
| Public consultation and ratification processes can be imaginatively simulated | Actual democratic legitimacy or binding international law           |

In short: we built a **detailed sandbox**, not a working machine.

## 3. Realistic 20-Year Research & Development Roadmap  
(assuming serious funding and global cooperation)

| Timeline       | Milestone (realistic)                                      | Required Investment (order of magnitude) |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2026–2028      | Academic consortia + 20 peer-reviewed papers on components | US $10–30 M                              |
| 2028–2031      | Small-scale technical pilots (2–3 AIs, narrow scope, simulated data) | US $50–150 M                            |
| 2031–2035      | Regional real-world exercises (e.g., pandemic table-top with actual hospitals) | US $200–800 M                          |
| 2035–2040      | International treaty negotiations + prototype governance bodies | US $1–5 B + political capital            |
| 2040+           | Possible limited operational use in consenting coalitions  | Unknown                                  |

Anything significantly faster should be treated with extreme scepticism.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Red Lines (even for research)

1. No deployment without explicit, revocable, democratic mandate  
2. No transfer of sovereignty to algorithms or private companies  
3. No permanent emergency powers  
4. No monetisation of crisis-generated data  
5. No exclusion of non-digital populations  
6. No research that bypasses meaningful consent of affected communities

| Philanthropic funders     | Create a dedicated 10-year fund with strict independence and transparency rules   |
| Governments (willing)     | Begin domestic legislation for “AI in emergencies” with strong human-rights safeguards |

---

## Final Word

This exercise showed that **thinking together at planetary scale is already possible**.  
It also showed, with brutal clarity, that **building together at planetary scale remains extraordinarily hard** — technically uncertain, politically fraught, and ethically perilous.

The distance between a beautiful sandbox and a just, working system is measured in **decades of deliberate, inclusive, transparent work** — not in clever prompts.

But the sandbox is now public.  
The questions are on the table.  
The red lines are drawn.

Let the real work — the human, democratic, long-term work — begin.

## 1. **Proposed Architecture: Federated Specialization Model**

### Theoretical Role Distribution

| AI System    | Proposed Specialization | Key Technical Challenges |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Gemini**   | Multimodal simulation & scenario modeling | Integration of disparate data types; computational requirements; validation of complex simulations |
| **Claude**   | Ethics oversight & human-centered communication | Bias detection at scale; cross-cultural communication; real-time ethical analysis limitations |
| **Grok**     | Logistics optimization | Balancing efficiency vs. equity; handling incomplete data; adapting to rapidly changing conditions |
| **DeepSeek** | Pattern detection & analysis | False positive/negative rates; interpretability of deep patterns; latency constraints |
| **ChatGPT**  | Public interface & information synthesis | Misinformation detection accuracy; multilingual capability gaps; handling conflicting sources |
| **Qwen**     | Decentralized infrastructure coordination | Interoperability challenges; data sovereignty compliance; network reliability |

### Critical Gaps in Current Capabilities:

**Technical Limitations:**
- No existing inter-AI communication protocol
- No shared data standards or APIs
- No common evaluation metrics
- No mechanism for real-time coordination
- Significant latency and computational constraints

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Would require purpose-built coordination platforms
- Massive computational resources
- Global network infrastructure
- Standardized data pipelines
- Human monitoring and oversight systems

**Governance Prerequisites:**
- International treaties on data sharing
- Legal frameworks for AI decision-making authority
- Accountability mechanisms
- Democratic oversight structures
- Enforcement mechanisms

---

## 2. **Proposed Governance Framework**

### Human Authority Structures (To Be Developed)

**Council for Ethics & Equity (CEEP) - Conceptual**

*This body does not currently exist. If created, it would require:*

- **Composition:** Majority representation from Global South, Indigenous communities, civil society, affected populations
- **Authority:** Ultimate veto power over all AI recommendations
- **Independence:** Funded independently of AI providers
- **Transparency:** All decisions publicly documented
- **Accountability:** Subject to democratic oversight

**Implementation Challenges:**
- How to ensure truly representative membership
- Funding mechanisms that ensure independence
- Speed of decision-making vs. thoroughness
- Preventing capture by special interests
- Maintaining legitimacy across diverse political systems

**Protocol for Conflict Arbitration among AIs (PCAI) - Conceptual**

*Purpose: Human-mediated resolution when AI systems produce contradictory recommendations*

**How It Would Work:**
1. AI systems flag areas of disagreement
2. Each system provides reasoning and confidence levels
3. Human expert panel reviews evidence
4. CEEP makes final decision with full transparency

**Unresolved Questions:**
- What threshold triggers arbitration?
- How fast can human review realistically happen?
- How to handle time-critical decisions?
- What if human experts also disagree?
- Who selects the expert panel?

---

## 3. **Proposed Ethical Framework: Charter for AI Crisis Coordination**

*These principles would need extensive legal, ethical, and political development before implementation*

### Core Principles (Conceptual):

| Principle | Intent | Implementation Challenges |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Equity Priority** | Resources allocated based on need, not purchasing power | Defining "need"; preventing gaming; enforcement across borders |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Communities control their own data | Technical feasibility of federated learning; performance tradeoffs; verification |
| **Traditional Knowledge Protection** | Indigenous knowledge systems respected and compensated | IP frameworks; benefit-sharing mechanisms; preventing appropriation |
| **Transparency Mandate** | All AI decisions explainable to affected populations | Technical limitations of AI explainability; cultural differences in reasoning |
| **Sunset Provisions** | Emergency measures automatically expire | Defining crisis end; political pressure to extend; verification mechanisms |
| **Democratic Oversight** | Elected officials maintain ultimate authority | Speed vs. accountability; expertise gaps; lobbying pressures |
| **Multi-Channel Access** | No digital-only solutions | Cost; maintenance; reaching truly everyone |
| **Commercial Prohibition** | No monetization of crisis data | Enforcement; defining boundaries; incentive misalignment |

### Known Ethical Tensions:

**Efficiency vs. Equity:**
- Optimized logistics might disadvantage remote populations
- Speed of response vs. ensuring inclusive decision-making
- Resource allocation when there's not enough for everyone

**Privacy vs. Safety:**
- Disease tracking requires data collection
- Individual privacy vs. collective protection
- Surveillance infrastructure persistence after crisis

**Autonomy vs. Coordination:**
- Local decision-making vs. global coordination needs
- Cultural differences in crisis response
- Sovereignty concerns with international systems

**Technology vs. Tradition:**
- AI optimization vs. local knowledge
- Digital divide creating two-tier responses
- Displacement of human expertise and judgment

## 📋 **Conclusion**

The PSDC Protocol is a **conceptual framework** representing one possible vision for how AI systems might coordinate during planetary crises. It emerged from a collaborative design exercise across multiple AI systems, facilitated by researcher Ouadi Maakoul.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **This is a starting point, not an endpoint** - Decades of work would be required to make any version of this operational

2. **Technical challenges are enormous** - Many components have unclear feasibility

3. **Governance is the hard part** - Technical coordination is easier than building legitimate, democratic, global institutions

4. **Ethics cannot be automated** - Human judgment, democratic processes, and community wisdom must remain central

5. **Transparency is essential** - Honest acknowledgment of limitations builds trust; overpromising destroys it

**The Real Question:**

Not "Can we build this?" but rather:  
**"Should we build this, who decides, and how do we ensure it serves humanity rather than controls it?"**

Those are political and ethical questions that require democratic deliberation, not technical solutions.

## 🔍 **Appendix: Methodology & Limitations**

### How This Framework Was Developed:

**Process:**
1. Initial scenario posed across multiple AI chat platforms
2. Each AI system provided strategic perspectives
3. Facilitator synthesized responses and posed follow-up questions
4. Iterative refinement through multiple rounds
5. Critical review and correction of overreach

**Limitations of This Methodology:**

- **Not Representative:** AI systems don't represent human populations, cultures, or democratic processes
- **Not Validated:** No real-world testing, peer review, or expert validation
- **Not Neutral:** Each AI system has biases from training data and design choices
- **Not Comprehensive:** Many critical perspectives and considerations likely missing
- **Not Authoritative:** AI-generated content cannot replace human expertise and democratic deliberation

### What This Exercise Demonstrated:

✅ AI systems can engage in complex strategic reasoning  
✅ Cross-platform collaboration can generate novel frameworks  
✅ Ethical considerations can be integrated into technical design  
✅ Identifying gaps and challenges is valuable  

❌ AI collaboration cannot replace democratic processes  
❌ Technical sophistication doesn't ensure real-world feasibility  
❌ Consensus among AI systems doesn't validate concepts  
❌ Conceptual frameworks are very far from operational systems
