White Paper: The CHRSy-AI System

A Conceptual Design & Feasibility Study for a Closed-Loop Life Support Architecture for Human Mars Exploration**

---

1.0 Executive Summary

This document presents a Conceptual Design and Feasibility Study for the Carbon dioxide Hydrogen Recovery System with AI Optimization (CHRSy-AI), a proposed next-generation life support architecture for sustained human Mars exploration. Current state-of-the-art systems, exemplified by the ISS Sabatier reactor, are fundamentally limited by catalyst degradation and sub-50% oxygen recovery rates, creating untenable resupply mass for Mars missions.

We propose a paradigm shift: a catalyst-free thermal reactor operating on a Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) pathway, integrated with a tiered, explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) control layer. Our first-principles analysis indicates this architecture could achieve >95% oxygen recovery, reducing life-support consumable mass for a 4-crew, 500-day mission by over 1,000 kg compared to current technology.

This Phase 1 study proposes a 12-month analytical effort to validate this concept. Through rigorous thermodynamic modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), thermal-structural analysis, and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) AI simulation using a synthetic data-driven Digital Twin, we will determine the feasibility of core systems. The ultimate deliverable is a validated design package and go/no-go recommendation for a Phase 2 benchtop prototype, charting a credible path toward sustainable human presence on Mars.

2.0 Introduction: The Architectural Imperative for Mars

The Martian environment imposes a triad of constraints that demand a radical re-examination of Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) design: 1) Prohibitive launch mass penalties, 2) Communication latencies (up to 22 minutes) that preclude real-time Earth control, and 3) An abrasive, dusty environment with extreme thermal cycles. Systems optimized for Low Earth Orbit, like the catalyst-dependent Sabatier process, are not directly transferable.

This white paper delivers a detailed conceptual design and analysis plan for an architecture engineered from first principles to meet these constraints. The CHRSy-AI concept seeks to eliminate consumable catalysts through robust thermal design and replace ground-dependent operations with trusted, autonomous machine intelligence. The central question of this study is: Does the catalyst-free, AI-managed pathway represent a viable and superior architectural solution for Mars surface life support?

3.0 Proposed System Architecture & Theoretical Foundations

The CHRSy-AI architecture is built upon three interconnected, novel conceptual pillars.

3.1 The CHRSy Chemical Core: A Catalyst-Free Pathway

The core innovation is a high-temperature reactor that processes Martian CO₂ without consumable catalysts, targeting the Reverse Water-Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction pathway:
CO₂ + H₂ ↔ CO + H₂O

· Proposed Operational Range: 850–950°C. This range is theorized to favorably shift the equilibrium constant (Kₚ) toward product formation without catalytic surfaces.
· Key Analytical Challenge & Hypothesis: At these temperatures, competing reactions like the Boudouard reaction (2CO ↔ C + CO₂) pose a risk of carbon fouling [1]. We hypothesize that precise, real-time control of the H₂:CO₂ inlet ratio is the critical parameter for suppressing carbon formation and maximizing H₂O yield. A core objective of this study is to model this balance and define the required control envelope.

3.2 The AI Optimization & Safety Layer: A Proposed Autonomy Architecture

To manage complex, real-time process control where Earth intervention is impossible, we propose a three-tiered software architecture:

· Tier 1: The Deterministic Guardian. A non-AI, hardware-based layer of immutable "if-then" safety interlocks (e.g., over-temperature cut-off). This tier provides the ultimate safety guarantee.
· Tier 2: The Explainable AI (XAI) Optimizer. An advanced machine learning model responsible for real-time process optimization. Its key feature is explainability (XAI), providing human-readable rationale for every control decision to build crew trust and facilitate oversight.
· Tier 3: The Predictive Sentinel. An analytical layer designed to perform Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) by analyzing system "health" signatures (vibration spectra, thermal gradients) to forecast mechanical failures well in advance.

3.3 The Martian Integration Layer: Proposed Environmental Solutions

· Dust & Atmospheric Processing: We propose a Cryogenic CO₂ Concentrator (CCC) as a front-end pre-processor. This stage is designed to freeze CO₂ out of the thin Martian atmosphere, simultaneously filtering abrasive dust and perchlorates while concentrating the feedstock.
· Hydrogen Parity – A Systems-Level Goal: The most transformative concept is "Hydrogen Parity" – the point where hydrogen recovered from crew metabolism (via food) and system recycling equals operational losses, creating a self-sustaining consumables loop independent of Earth resupply. This frames the life support system as an integrated biological-mechanical ecosystem.

4.0 Proposed Analytical Methodology & Success Metrics

This Phase 1 is a modeling and simulation study. The following workflow defines our rigorous analytical approach.

4.1 Thermodynamic, Kinetic, & Mass-Balance Modeling

· Objective: To theoretically confirm the feasibility of >95% oxygen recovery via the catalyst-free RWGS pathway and establish the Hydrogen Parity mass balance.
· Tool: ASPEN Plus / Chemical Equilibrium Software.
· Key Task: Model reaction equilibria, byproduct formation, and the sensitivity of output to H₂:CO₂ ratio and temperature swings.
· Deliverable & Success Metric: A validated process model and the theoretical 500-Day Consumables Roadmap (Table 1), demonstrating the potential mass savings.

Consumable / Component ISS Sabatier (~54% Recovery) CHRSy-AI Concept (>95% Target) Theoretical Mass Saving
Oxygen (O₂) 773 kg 84 kg 689 kg
Hydrogen (H₂) Buffer 105 kg 10 kg 95 kg
Spare Catalysts 250 kg 0 kg 250 kg
TOTAL MASS 1,128 kg 94 kg 1,034 kg

4.2 Computational Fluid Dynamics & Thermal-Structural Analysis

· Objective: To design a reactor geometry for optimal heat/flow management and to evaluate candidate materials under Martian thermal cycles.
· Tool: ANSYS Fluent / COMSOL Multiphysics.
· Key Task – Low-Cycle Fatigue (LCF) Analysis: A primary failure mode for a high-temperature surface system is cyclic thermal stress from daily/nightly temperature swings [2]. Our CFD and stress models will explicitly simulate these cycles to predict stress accumulation and guide geometry/material selection (e.g., Mo or W alloys [3]).
· Success Metric: Identification of a primary and secondary liner material candidate with predicted fatigue life exceeding mission requirements.

4.3 AI Software Development & Digital Twin Simulation

· Objective: To develop and test the tri-tiered AI control architecture in a high-fidelity simulated environment.
· Tool: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch) / MATLAB Simulink.
· Key Innovation – Synthetic Data & Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Lacking physical data, we will generate synthetic operational and fault data from our ASPEN and CFD models. The Tier 2 AI Optimizer will be trained using Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) within this "Digital Twin" simulation [4].
· Success Metric: A functional SIL simulation where the AI maintains system stability and optimizes yield across thousands of simulated mission hours, including fault scenarios.

4.4 Preliminary Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (pFMEA)

A core deliverable will be a pFMEA that systematically analyzes the novel risks of our proposed architecture (e.g., AI logic errors, thermal fatigue, hydrogen leakage) and defines the analytical or design strategies to mitigate them in subsequent phases.

6.0 Conclusion

The CHRSy-AI study proposes a theoretically compelling architectural shift for Mars life support, moving from consumable-dependent systems to durable, autonomous, closed-loop ecosystems. By reframing the human habitat as an integrated bio-mechanical system and targeting Hydrogen Parity, it offers a path to radical mass reduction and true operational independence.

This proposal outlines a rigorous, 12-month analytical plan to transform this vision into a quantitatively vetted design. Success will be measured not by built hardware, but by validated models, a clear risk catalog, and a definitive recommendation on the viability of this next-generation approach. Completing this work will provide NASA with the critical analysis needed to decide if the catalyst-free, AI-managed pathway should be a cornerstone of future Mars mission architecture.

A.1 Risk Identification Framework
Risks will be cataloged through a top-down Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) and a bottom-up subsystem analysis.

· Functional Hazards: Derived from top-level system requirements (e.g., "Loss of Oxygen Production," "Uncontrolled Hydrogen Release," "False Autonomous Shutdown").
· Subsystem Analysis: Each proposed subsystem (Reactor, AI Controller, CCC, H2 Management) will be examined for potential failure modes based on its operational theory and analogous technologies.

A.2 Preliminary Failure Modes & Effects Analysis (pFMEA) Template
The following table outlines the planned analytical structure. Specific failure modes, effects, and controls will be populated during the study based on modeling outputs.

Item / Function Potential Failure Mode (To Be Analyzed) Postulated Effect on Mission Sev. (Est.) Proposed Mitigation Strategy Analysis
CHRSy Reactor Core Carbon Fouling (Soot) Reduced heat transfer & flow, declining O2 yield, potential clog. 7 Modeling Task: Determine the H2:CO2 ratio "safe window" via ASPEN kinetics modeling to suppress Boudouard reaction.
 Liner Crack (Thermal Fatigue) Loss of pressure containment, process gas leak into habitat. 9 Analysis Task: Perform Low-Cycle Fatigue (LCF) simulation in COMSOL to predict crack initiation cycles for candidate materials.
AI Tier 2 Optimizer Control Instability (Oscillation) Cycling pressure/temperature damages hardware, wastes resources. 8 Simulation Task: Implement and test robust control algorithms (e.g., Proportional-Integral-Derivative with adaptive gain) in the Digital Twin under noise.
 Overfitting to Training Data Poor performance when encountering un-modeled Martian conditions (e.g., novel dust storm). 6 Methodology: Employ k-fold cross-validation during AI training and inject randomized noise/perturbations into synthetic data set.
Cryogenic CO2 Concentrator Water Ice Clogging Blocked cold plates, catastrophic drop in CO2 feed rate. 8 Design Analysis: Model the required pre-cooling and heating cycle timing to manage H2O freeze-out before CO2 deposition.
H2 Storage (Metal Hydride) Contamination-Induced Capacity Loss Reduced H2 buffer, endangering Hydrogen Parity. 7 Modeling Task: Analyze literature on poisoning thresholds for candidate hydrides by trace gases (e.g., CO, O2) to specify purity requirements.

A.3 Risk Assessment & Down-Selection
A Risk Matrix (Likelihood vs. Severity per NASA standards) will be created from the pFMEA. High-scoring risks will become Key Technical Risks and drive priority for deeper analysis in Phase 1 and specific testing in Phase 2.
