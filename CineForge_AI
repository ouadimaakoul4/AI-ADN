Abstract

The automated generation of full-length films using artificial intelligence presents a grand challenge in multimodal AI, requiring solutions to long-form narrative coherence, visual consistency, and intelligent editing. This thesis proposes CineForge AI, a novel hierarchical framework for end-to-end film generation. The core contribution is a multi-agent pipeline consisting of: (1) a Hierarchical Transformer for script generation with global narrative memory; (2) a diffusion-based video generation module using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ControlNet for persistent character anchoring; and (3) a novel Automated Assembly Engine that frames video editing as a multi-constraint optimization problem, solved via Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning. The research also introduces a new evaluation framework for long-form generative video and addresses critical ethical considerations. The prototype demonstrates the ability to generate coherent short-to-medium-length films, advancing the state-of-the-art in AI-driven content creation.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1. Motivation

Filmmaking is one of the most collaborative and resource-intensive art forms, often requiring hundreds of skilled professionals and millions of dollars to produce a single feature-length film. This high barrier to entry limits the diversity of voices and stories that can be brought to the screen. Recent advances in artificial intelligence—particularly in large language models (LLMs), diffusion-based image and video synthesis, and neural audio generation—have demonstrated the potential to automate creative tasks. However, current AI systems are limited to generating short, isolated clips that lack narrative structure, visual consistency, and cinematic editing.

The vision of this thesis is to democratize filmmaking by creating an AI system capable of generating a complete, coherent film from a simple idea. Achieving this requires solving fundamental research problems in multimodal AI: maintaining character identity across hundreds of shots, ensuring narrative logic over long time horizons, and automatically assembling thousands of clips into a rhythmically pleasing and semantically coherent whole. This work aims to bridge the gap between short-form generation and long-form cinematic storytelling.

1.2. Problem Statement

Despite rapid progress in generative models, the following challenges remain unsolved for long-form film generation:

Temporal and Latent Consistency: Current video models exhibit "character drift"—the appearance of a character changes subtly between shots—and "style flicker" due to the stochastic nature of diffusion models. This violates the fundamental requirement of visual continuity in cinema. When a character reappears after several scenes, there is no guarantee that their facial features, clothing, or even body type will remain consistent. This problem is exacerbated in long-form content where hundreds of independent generation calls are made.

Narrative Grounding: Large language models can generate compelling scripts, but ensuring that every generated scene adheres to a global narrative arc, character development, and plot points across a 90-minute runtime requires a persistent memory mechanism beyond the context window of standard transformers. A model generating scene 75 must remember the emotional state of a character established in scene 12, a task that pushes the limits of current architectures.

Automated Assembly: Editing is a subjective and complex task that involves choosing the right shots, timing cuts to the rhythm of the audio, and maintaining spatial and temporal continuity (e.g., the 180-degree rule, match on action). Existing video stitching techniques are manual or heuristic-based; an AI must learn cinematic grammar and optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. The assembly problem is not merely about concatenation but about creating an emergent experience greater than the sum of its parts.

Evaluation: Standard metrics for video generation (e.g., Fréchet Video Distance, Inception Score) do not capture narrative coherence, character consistency, or editing quality. A film could have visually impressive individual frames but tell an incoherent story or contain jarring cuts. A new multi-faceted evaluation framework is needed that correlates with human judgment of cinematic quality.

1.3. Research Questions

This thesis addresses the following primary research question:

How can we design an end-to-end AI framework that generates a full-length film with narrative coherence, visual consistency, and cinematic quality from a high-level user prompt?

This primary question decomposes into four subordinate research questions:

RQ1 (Narrative): How can we represent and maintain a global narrative state across a long-form script such that each generated scene remains consistent with the overall story arc, character development, and plot logic established in previous scenes?

RQ2 (Visual): How can we anchor the identity of characters and the visual style of the film in the latent space of a diffusion model to prevent drift across independently generated video clips, while still allowing for varied poses, expressions, and lighting conditions?

RQ3 (Editing): How can we formulate the problem of automated video editing as a sequential decision process that optimizes multiple competing objectives—visual continuity, audio rhythm, narrative alignment, and cinematic grammar—and learn an effective policy for shot selection and transition choice?

RQ4 (Evaluation): How can we construct a composite evaluation metric that quantifies the quality of a generated film across narrative, visual, and auditory dimensions in a way that correlates with human perception?

1.4. Research Objectives

To answer these research questions, we pursue the following objectives:

RO1: Hierarchical Script Generation with Global Narrative Memory. Develop a script generation model that operates hierarchically: a high-level planner generates plot points and character arcs, while a low-level scene writer expands each plot point into detailed dialogue and action. A persistent narrative state vector is maintained and updated after each scene, capturing the essential context required for future coherence. This state conditions the generation of subsequent scenes, ensuring long-range narrative consistency.

RO2: Latent-Consistent Video Generation via Character Anchoring. Design a video generation module that ensures visual consistency across scenes. For each principal character, we fine-tune a set of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights on reference images, anchoring the character's appearance in the latent space of a pre-trained diffusion model. During generation for any scene involving that character, the corresponding LoRA weights are activated. Additionally, a style embedding extracted from the first scene is used to condition all subsequent scenes via ControlNet, maintaining consistent lighting and color palette. A regularization term in the diffusion loss further minimizes the distance between face embeddings of the same character across different generations.

RO3: Reinforcement Learning-Based Automated Assembly Engine. Formulate video editing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The state includes the last frames of the previous shot, the current narrative state, and the upcoming script beat. Actions consist of selecting a candidate shot and a transition type. The reward function is a weighted combination of: (a) visual continuity (negative perceptual distance between consecutive shots), (b) rhythm alignment (correlation of cuts with audio onsets), (c) narrative fidelity (CLIP similarity between shot content and script beat), and (d) cinematic grammar (score from a classifier trained to detect editing violations). We train a policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on a dataset of professionally edited films to learn optimal shot sequencing.

RO4: Multi-Faceted Evaluation Framework. Propose a composite evaluation metric that quantifies film quality along four axes: (1) narrative coherence measured via BERTScore between generated script summaries and human-authored references; (2) visual consistency measured by the inverse of mean face embedding variance across character appearances and by frame-to-frame perceptual distance to quantify flicker; (3) audio-visual alignment measured by lip-sync accuracy and sound effect timing; and (4) editing quality measured by average rhythm reward and frequency of grammar violations. Validate this metric through correlation with human subjective ratings in user studies.

RO5: Prototype Implementation and Empirical Validation. Implement the complete CineForge AI pipeline using state-of-the-art foundation models. Conduct quantitative experiments to evaluate each component against baselines, and perform qualitative user studies to assess the overall quality of generated short-to-medium-length films (10–20 minutes). Release an open-source version of the framework to foster further research.

1.5. Thesis Contributions

The main contributions of this thesis are:

CineForge AI Architecture: A novel hierarchical multi-agent architecture for end-to-end film generation that integrates narrative planning, consistent video synthesis, automated editing, and audio synchronization into a unified pipeline with feedback loops for error correction.

Latent Anchoring Method for Character Consistency: A technique combining Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for per-character fine-tuning and ControlNet for style conditioning, augmented with a face-embedding regularization loss. This method demonstrably reduces character drift across independently generated video clips compared to baseline approaches.

Formalization of Automated Editing as an MDP: A rigorous mathematical formulation of the video editing problem as a Markov Decision Process with a multi-component reward function that captures visual, rhythmic, narrative, and grammatical constraints. A learned RL policy that outperforms heuristic and supervised baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

Composite Evaluation Framework for Long-Form Generative Video: A set of quantitative metrics designed specifically for long-form AI-generated films, validated against human judgments. This provides a benchmark for future research in this emerging area.

Open-Source Prototype: A fully implemented and documented prototype system capable of generating coherent short-to-medium-length films (10–20 minutes), along with detailed experimental results and ablation studies. The codebase, models, and datasets will be released to the research community.

Ethical Framework for AI-Generated Cinema: A comprehensive discussion of the ethical implications of automated film generation, including copyright, impact on creative professions, misinformation risks, and bias mitigation, accompanied by technical safeguards such as invisible watermarking.

1.6. Scope and Delimitations

This thesis focuses on the technical challenges of generating narrative-driven fictional films. The following delimitations apply:

Length: The primary proof-of-concept targets films of 10–20 minutes duration. While the architecture is designed to scale to feature length, empirical validation at that scale is computationally prohibitive within the timeframe of a PhD.

Genre: The system is evaluated primarily on narrative fiction (drama, sci-fi, fantasy). Documentaries, experimental films, and other non-narrative forms are outside the current scope.

Interactivity: The system operates in a fully automated mode from a single initial prompt. Interactive or iterative refinement during generation is left for future work.

Realism: The generated videos, while visually coherent, may not achieve photorealistic quality comparable to high-budget live-action films. The focus is on narrative and consistency rather than pixel-perfect realism.

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.1. Introduction

The vision of automated film generation sits at the intersection of several rapidly advancing fields: generative video synthesis, natural language generation, computer vision, and computational creativity. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to each component of the proposed CineForge AI framework. We organize the review into five thematic areas: (2.2) generative models for video synthesis, (2.3) narrative generation with large language models, (2.4) techniques for visual consistency in generative media, (2.5) automated video editing and assembly, and (2.6) evaluation metrics for generative video. Within each area, we trace the evolution of key ideas, identify current state-of-the-art methods, and critically assess their limitations with respect to the long-form film generation problem. Section 2.7 synthesizes these findings and identifies the specific research gaps that this thesis addresses.

2.2. Generative Models for Video Synthesis

2.2.1. Early Approaches: RNNs and GANs

The earliest attempts at video generation relied on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model temporal dependencies. Srivastava et al. (2015) proposed unsupervised learning of video representations using LSTM autoencoders, demonstrating the ability to predict future frames. However, the generated videos were low-resolution and suffered from blurring due to the inherent limitations of pixel-space prediction with L1 or L2 losses.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) offered a paradigm shift by learning to generate samples that fool a discriminator. Video GANs extended this idea by incorporating temporal discriminators. VGAN (Vondrick et al., 2016) used a 3D convolutional generator and a spatio-temporal discriminator to generate short video clips of scenes like golf swings and faces. MoCoGAN (Tulyakov et al., 2018) decomposed the latent space into a content component (static) and a motion component (time-varying), allowing for more controlled generation. While these models produced sharper results than RNN-based approaches, they were limited to short clips (typically 1-2 seconds) and specific domains, and they struggled with mode collapse and training instability.

2.2.2. Diffusion Models for Image Synthesis

The introduction of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al., 2020) revolutionized generative modeling. Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process. They achieved state-of-the-art image quality, surpassing GANs on many benchmarks. Key innovations include:

· Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM): Ho et al. (2020) established the basic framework, showing that a simple mean-squared error loss for noise prediction could generate high-quality samples.
· Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM): Song et al. (2021) introduced a non-Markovian sampling process that requires fewer steps, making generation more efficient.
· Classifier-Free Guidance: Ho and Salimans (2022) showed that conditioning could be achieved without a separate classifier by mixing conditional and unconditional score estimates, enabling fine-grained control over generation.

2.2.3. Latent Diffusion Models

Rombach et al. (2022) proposed Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), which perform the diffusion process in a compressed latent space learned by a variational autoencoder (VAE). This dramatically reduces computational requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. Stable Diffusion, built on this architecture, became the foundation for a wave of text-to-image applications. The key insight is that perceptual compression (removing high-frequency details) can be separated from semantic generation, allowing diffusion models to focus on the latter.

2.2.4. Video Diffusion Models

Extending diffusion models to video requires modeling the temporal dimension. Ho et al. (2022) introduced Video Diffusion Models (VDM), which factorize the joint distribution over frames into a product of conditional distributions and use 3D U-Net architectures with temporal attention. This approach generates consistent short videos but is computationally expensive and limited to fixed-length outputs.

Subsequent work has focused on improving efficiency and length:

· Imagen Video (Ho et al., 2022): A cascade of diffusion models that generates high-resolution videos by upsampling in space and time. It uses temporal super-resolution models to increase frame rate and duration.
· Make-A-Video (Singer et al., 2022): Leverages text-image pairs for training and learns temporal dynamics from unsupervised video data, enabling text-to-video generation without paired text-video data.
· Stable Video Diffusion (Blattmann et al., 2023): Adapts the Stable Diffusion architecture to video by inflating 2D convolutions to 3D and adding temporal attention layers. It supports variable-length generation and fine-tuning for specific domains.

Despite these advances, current video diffusion models are fundamentally limited to short clips (typically 4-16 seconds). Generating a full-length film requires assembling hundreds or thousands of such clips, which introduces the consistency problems central to this thesis.

2.2.5. Control Mechanisms for Diffusion Models

For practical applications, controlling the output of diffusion models is essential. Several techniques have emerged:

· ControlNet (Zhang and Agrawala, 2023): Adds conditional control to pre-trained diffusion models by training a copy of the encoder that takes conditioning inputs (e.g., edges, depth maps, poses) and injects features into the main network. This allows fine-grained spatial control without modifying the base model.
· Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021): Originally developed for language models, LoRA has been adapted for diffusion models. It freezes the base model and learns low-rank matrices that are added to specific layers, enabling efficient fine-tuning for new concepts or styles with minimal parameters.
· DreamBooth (Ruiz et al., 2023): Fine-tunes the entire diffusion model on a few images of a subject, associating it with a unique identifier. This enables personalized generation but risks overfitting and requires more compute than LoRA.

These control mechanisms are crucial for the character anchoring and style consistency required in long-form film generation.

2.3. Narrative Generation with Large Language Models

2.3.1. Evolution of Language Models

The transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) enabled the development of large language models (LLMs) with unprecedented generative capabilities. GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) demonstrated coherent paragraph-level generation, while GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) scaled to 175 billion parameters and exhibited few-shot learning abilities. More recent models like Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) have further improved reasoning, instruction following, and creative writing.

2.3.2. Story and Script Generation

Applying LLMs to narrative generation has been extensively explored. Early work used fine-tuned GPT-2 for story continuation (See et al., 2019). More recent approaches include:

· Hierarchical Story Generation: Fan et al. (2018) proposed generating stories in two stages: a high-level prompt and then a detailed expansion. This mirrors the human creative process and improves coherence.
· Plot and Character Consistency: Yao et al. (2019) introduced a planning mechanism that maintains character states and plot points, updating them as the story progresses. This is implemented via a structured memory that tracks entities and their relationships.
· Script-Specific Models: Screenplay generation requires formatting, dialogue attribution, and scene descriptions. Models fine-tuned on screenplay corpora (e.g., IMSDb) can learn these conventions (Papalampidi et al., 2021).

2.3.3. Long-Context and Memory Mechanisms

Standard transformers have a fixed context window (typically 2K-8K tokens), limiting their ability to maintain coherence over book-length or film-length narratives. Several solutions have been proposed:

· Hierarchical Transformers: Models like Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) use sparse attention patterns to extend context length to tens of thousands of tokens. However, they still treat the entire sequence as a flat structure, which may not capture narrative hierarchy.
· External Memory: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) stores document chunks in a vector database and retrieves relevant context during generation. For narratives, this could mean retrieving past scenes relevant to the current one.
· Compressive Memory: Models like RMT (Bulatov et al., 2022) maintain a compressed representation of past context that is updated incrementally. This is analogous to the narrative state vector proposed in this thesis.

2.3.4. Limitations for Long-Form Film Scripts

Current narrative generation systems have three key limitations for film-length scripts:

1. Context Window: Even extended-context models cannot hold an entire 90-minute screenplay (approximately 20,000 words or 25,000 tokens) in memory with full attention.
2. Scene-Level Granularity: Most story generation systems produce paragraphs, not structured scenes with dialogue, action, camera directions, and character lists.
3. Integration with Visual Generation: Generated scripts must be parseable by downstream visual generation modules, requiring structured output formats and scene-level metadata.

2.4. Techniques for Visual Consistency in Generative Media

2.4.1. The Problem of Identity Preservation

Identity preservation—ensuring that a character looks the same across different images or videos—is a well-recognized challenge in generative AI. In the context of film, this problem is exacerbated by the need for consistency across hundreds of independent generation calls, each potentially using different seeds and prompts.

2.4.2. Image-Level Consistency Methods

Several approaches have been developed for consistent image generation:

· Textual Inversion (Gal et al., 2022): Learns a new token embedding representing a concept from a few images. During generation, the token can be used in prompts to evoke the concept. However, the concept is represented only in the embedding space, which may not capture fine visual details.
· DreamBooth (Ruiz et al., 2023): Fine-tunes the entire diffusion model on a few images of a subject, associating it with a unique identifier. This produces strong identity preservation but requires full model fine-tuning and risks overfitting.
· LoRA (Hu et al., 2021): As mentioned, LoRA adds low-rank matrices to specific layers. For identity preservation, LoRA can be trained on reference images and then activated during generation. It strikes a balance between identity fidelity and parameter efficiency.
· Face Embedding Conditioning: Some approaches extract face embeddings (e.g., from ArcFace) and condition the generation on these embeddings directly (Wei et al., 2023). This ensures that generated faces match the embedding, but may not capture clothing, hairstyle, or other identity-defining attributes.

2.4.3. Video-Level Consistency

For video, consistency must be maintained both within a clip (temporal coherence) and across clips (long-range coherence). Within-clip consistency is addressed by video diffusion models through temporal attention layers. Across-clip consistency is an open problem that this thesis directly addresses.

2.4.4. Style Consistency

Beyond characters, films require consistent visual style—lighting, color palette, texture—across scenes. Style transfer techniques (Gatys et al., 2016) can apply a reference style to new content. In the diffusion context, style can be conditioned via:

· Style Embeddings: Extracting a style vector from reference images and injecting it via cross-attention.
· ControlNet with Style Inputs: Using a ControlNet conditioned on a style image to guide generation.

2.4.5. Gaps in Current Consistency Research

No existing approach addresses the combination of character identity and style consistency across hundreds of independently generated video clips. Furthermore, existing methods assume that all generations for a given character will use the same reference images, but in film, characters appear in varied poses, lighting conditions, and emotional states, requiring flexibility within the identity constraint.

2.5. Automated Video Editing and Assembly

2.5.1. Traditional Video Editing

Professional video editing is a complex craft involving shot selection, cutting, transitions, pacing, and audio synchronization. Editors follow conventions such as:

· Continuity Editing: Maintaining spatial and temporal coherence (e.g., match on action, eyeline match).
· Rhythmic Editing: Cutting in sync with music or dialogue rhythm.
· Narrative Editing: Using shots to advance the story and convey emotion.

Automating this process requires encoding these principles algorithmically.

2.5.2. Shot Selection and Sequencing

Early work on automated editing focused on multi-camera setups. The Virtual Director (He et al., 1996) used rules to select camera angles in virtual environments. More recently, machine learning has been applied:

· Supervised Learning for Shot Selection: Models can be trained to predict which shot a human editor would choose given context (Chen et al., 2017). However, this approach merely imitates human choices without understanding the underlying objectives.
· Reinforcement Learning for Camera Control: Jin et al. (2020) used RL to select camera shots in multi-view video, with rewards based on visibility of action and aesthetic criteria. This is closer to the approach proposed in this thesis, but applied to camera selection rather than shot sequencing from generated clips.

2.5.3. Cut Detection and Transition Optimization

Detecting optimal cut points has been explored in the context of video summarization and highlight detection. Chu and Roy (2017) used audio-visual synchronization to align cuts with musical beats. For transitions, frame interpolation techniques like RIFE (Huang et al., 2022) and FILM (Reda et al., 2022) can generate smooth intermediate frames between two shots.

2.5.4. Learning Cinematic Grammar

Several attempts have been made to learn editing conventions from data. Leake et al. (2020) developed a system that learns to edit interview footage by analyzing patterns in professionally edited videos. Wang et al. (2022) used graph neural networks to represent shot relationships and predict editing decisions.

2.5.5. Gaps in Automated Editing Research

Existing work on automated editing assumes that all footage is already captured and that the editor's job is selection and ordering. In the context of AI-generated film, we have the additional challenge that shots are generated on demand, and we have control over the generation parameters. Furthermore, no existing system optimizes simultaneously for visual continuity, audio rhythm, narrative alignment, and cinematic grammar within a unified framework.

2.6. Evaluation Metrics for Generative Video

2.6.1. Standard Metrics

The evaluation of generative video has relied on metrics adapted from image generation:

· Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) (Unterthiner et al., 2018): Extends FID to video by using a 3D convolutional neural network to extract features and computing the Fréchet distance between real and generated distributions. FVD captures temporal dynamics but not narrative coherence.
· Inception Score (IS): Measures both image quality and diversity but does not account for temporal aspects.
· LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018): Learned perceptual similarity metric that correlates well with human judgment of image similarity. Can be applied frame-wise to video.
· CLIP Score (Hessel et al., 2021): Measures alignment between text and image using CLIP embeddings. For video, it can be averaged across frames or applied to key frames.

2.6.2. Narrative Coherence Evaluation

Evaluating narrative coherence is inherently subjective. Automated approaches include:

· BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020): Computes token-level similarity between generated and reference texts using BERT embeddings. Can be used to compare generated scripts to human-authored references.
· Story Cloze Test (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016): A benchmark for story understanding that requires selecting the correct ending from two options. This tests narrative logic.
· GPT-based Evaluation: Recent work uses LLMs as judges, prompting them to rate narrative coherence (Liu et al., 2023). This shows promise but requires careful prompt design to avoid bias.

2.6.3. Character Consistency Metrics

Quantifying character consistency across images or videos can be done using face recognition models:

· Face Embedding Distance: Extract embeddings using pre-trained models (e.g., ArcFace, FaceNet) and compute distances between all pairs of images containing the same character. Lower variance indicates better consistency.
· Re-Identification Accuracy: Treat character consistency as a re-identification problem and measure how accurately a model can match generated images of the same character.

2.6.4. Editing Quality Metrics

Few metrics exist specifically for editing quality. Potential approaches include:

· Rhythm Alignment: Measure correlation between cut times and audio onset strength.
· Grammar Violation Rate: Train a classifier to detect common editing errors (jump cuts, crossing the line) and count violations.
· User Studies: Ultimately, subjective human evaluation remains the gold standard for creative content.

2.6.5. Gaps in Evaluation

No existing metric combines narrative, visual, and auditory dimensions into a single framework for long-form generative video. Furthermore, standard metrics are designed for short clips and do not scale to film-length content. A contribution of this thesis is a composite evaluation framework tailored to this domain.

2.7. Synthesis and Research Gaps

This review has identified several critical gaps in the literature that motivate the research presented in this thesis:

Gap 1: Integrated Long-Form Pipeline. No existing system combines narrative generation, consistent video synthesis, and automated editing into a single end-to-end pipeline for film-length content. Current work addresses these components in isolation.

Gap 2: Cross-Clip Character Consistency. While techniques like DreamBooth and LoRA can preserve identity within a single generation session, no method addresses the challenge of maintaining consistency across hundreds of independently generated video clips with varying contexts, poses, and lighting.

Gap 3: Formalization of Automated Editing as Multi-Objective Optimization. Existing editing systems use heuristics or supervised learning, but none formulate editing as a sequential decision problem with multiple competing objectives that can be optimized via reinforcement learning.

Gap 4: Narrative Memory for Long-Form Script Generation. Current LLMs lack mechanisms to maintain a compressed representation of narrative state across an entire film-length script, leading to inconsistencies in character arcs and plot logic.

Gap 5: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework. There is no established set of metrics for evaluating long-form AI-generated films across narrative, visual, and auditory dimensions in a way that correlates with human judgment.

The CineForge AI framework proposed in this thesis directly addresses these gaps through its hierarchical multi-agent architecture, latent space anchoring for character consistency, MDP-based editing formulation, and composite evaluation framework. The following chapter formalizes the problem mathematically, setting the stage for the detailed presentation of our approach.

Chapter 3: Problem Formulation

3.1. Introduction

This chapter provides a rigorous mathematical formulation of the long-form film generation problem. We begin by defining the key components of a film—script, scenes, shots, and the final video—and introduce notation that will be used throughout the thesis. We then formalize the constraints that a generated film must satisfy: narrative coherence, visual consistency, editing quality, and audio-visual alignment. Finally, we state the overall optimization objective and decompose it into subproblems corresponding to the components of the CineForge AI architecture.

3.2. Formal Definitions

3.2.1. Film Representation

A film can be represented hierarchically. At the highest level, we have a script  \mathcal{S}  consisting of an ordered sequence of scenes:

\mathcal{S} = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N)

where  N  is the number of scenes (typically 40-60 for a feature-length film).

Each scene  s_i  is a tuple:

s_i = (l_i, \mathcal{C}_i, \mathcal{D}_i, \mathcal{A}_i, \mathcal{B}_i)

where:

·  l_i  is the location (e.g., "INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY")
·  \mathcal{C}_i = \{c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, \ldots, c_{i,K_i}\}  is the set of characters present in the scene
·  \mathcal{D}_i = (d_{i,1}, d_{i,2}, \ldots, d_{i,M_i})  is the dialogue, with each  d_{i,j}  being a tuple (character, text)
·  \mathcal{A}_i  is the action description (narrative text describing character movements and events)
·  \mathcal{B}_i = (b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, \ldots, b_{i,P_i})  is a sequence of beats—the smallest narrative units within a scene, each corresponding to a specific story moment

Each beat  b_{i,j}  is associated with a shot type recommendation (e.g., close-up, wide shot, over-the-shoulder) and a brief description of the visual content.

3.2.2. Shot Representation

For each beat  b_{i,j} , we generate multiple candidate shots. A shot  x  is a short video clip of duration  \tau(x)  (typically 2-10 seconds), represented as a sequence of frames:

x = (f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_T)

where each frame  f_t  is an RGB image of dimensions  H \times W \times 3 .

For a given beat  b_{i,j} , we generate a set of candidate shots:

\mathcal{X}_{i,j} = \{x_{i,j,1}, x_{i,j,2}, \ldots, x_{i,j,Q_{i,j}}\}

The total pool of shots for the entire film is:

\mathcal{X} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} \bigcup_{j=1}^{P_i} \mathcal{X}_{i,j}

3.2.3. Final Film

The final film  \mathcal{F}  is a sequence of shots with associated transition types:

\mathcal{F} = ((x_{\pi(1)}, \tau_1), (x_{\pi(2)}, \tau_2), \ldots, (x_{\pi(K)}, \tau_K))

where  \pi  is a permutation indexing selected shots from  \mathcal{X}  (with the constraint that shots from later beats cannot appear before shots from earlier beats), and each  \tau_k  is a transition type (cut, fade, dissolve, wipe, etc.). The total duration of the film is  \sum_{k=1}^{K} \tau(x_{\pi(k)}) , accounting for transition overlaps.

3.2.4. Narrative State

We define a narrative state  \mathbf{h}_t  that captures the essential context up to a given point in the film. This is a continuous vector in  \mathbb{R}^d  that evolves over time. The narrative state at the beginning of scene  s_i  is  \mathbf{h}_{s_i} , and it is updated after each scene based on the events that occurred.

3.2.5. Character Identity Representation

For each character  c , we define a character identity embedding  \mathbf{e}_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_c}  extracted from reference images using a face recognition model (e.g., ArcFace). During generation, we aim to ensure that all visual representations of character  c  are close to this embedding in the latent space.

3.3. Constraints and Objectives

The film generation problem involves satisfying multiple constraints and optimizing multiple objectives. We formalize each below.

3.3.1. Narrative Coherence Constraint

The sequence of scenes must form a logically coherent story. This means that the narrative state at any point must be consistent with the history, and future events must follow plausibly from past events. Formally, we require that there exists a narrative state update function  \Phi  such that:

\mathbf{h}_{s_{i+1}} = \Phi(\mathbf{h}_{s_i}, s_i)

and that the narrative state at the end of the film,  \mathbf{h}_{s_N} , represents a satisfying resolution of the story arcs introduced at the beginning. In practice, this is enforced during script generation by ensuring that the script  \mathcal{S}  is internally consistent.

3.3.2. Visual Consistency Constraints

Character Consistency: For any two frames  f_a  and  f_b  that depict the same character  c , the distance between their character embeddings should be small:

\forall f_a, f_b \in \bigcup_{i,j} \bigcup_{x \in \mathcal{X}_{i,j}} \text{frames}(x) \text{ with character } c, \quad \| \phi_c(f_a) - \phi_c(f_b) \|_2 \leq \epsilon_c

where  \phi_c  is a function that extracts the character's face embedding from a frame, and  \epsilon_c  is a threshold.

Style Consistency: The visual style (color palette, lighting, texture) should be consistent across scenes. If we define a style embedding  \psi(x)  for a clip  x , we require:

\| \psi(x_a) - \psi(x_b) \|_2 \leq \epsilon_s \quad \forall x_a, x_b \in \mathcal{X}

3.3.3. Editing Quality Objectives

The editing should optimize multiple objectives simultaneously:

Visual Continuity: When two shots  x_a  and  x_b  are placed consecutively, the transition should be visually smooth. For a cut, this means that the last frame of  x_a  and the first frame of  x_b  should be perceptually similar:

\text{LPIPS}(f_{\text{last}}(x_a), f_{\text{first}}(x_b)) \leq \epsilon_{\text{cut}}

For dissolves and other transitions, intermediate frames generated by interpolation should also maintain perceptual quality.

Rhythmic Alignment: Cuts should align with the rhythm of the audio. Let  A(t)  be the audio waveform, and let  O(t)  be its onset strength envelope (a function that peaks at moments of rhythmic emphasis). For a sequence of cut times  \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_K\} , we want to maximize:

R_{\text{rhythm}} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K O(t_k)

Narrative Alignment: Each shot should visually represent its corresponding script beat. If  b  is the beat associated with shot  x , and  \text{CLIP}(x, b)  measures the similarity between the shot's visual content and the beat description, we want to maximize:

R_{\text{narrative}}(x) = \text{CLIP}(x, b)

Cinematic Grammar: The editing should avoid common violations such as jump cuts (where consecutive shots of the same subject are too similar in angle and scale), crossing the 180-degree line (which disorients viewers), and mismatched eyelines. We can define a grammar score  G(x_a, x_b)  that penalizes violations.

3.3.4. Audio-Visual Alignment

For dialogue, lip movements should be synchronized with the audio. If  \text{LipSync}(x, a)  measures the accuracy of lip-sync between video clip  x  and its associated dialogue audio  a , we require:

\text{LipSync}(x, a) \geq \epsilon_{\text{lip}}

For sound effects, the timing of the effect should match the on-screen action. This is typically verified manually in user studies.

3.4. Overall Optimization Problem

The long-form film generation problem can now be stated as: Given a user prompt  P , generate a film  \mathcal{F}  that satisfies the narrative coherence constraint and maximizes a weighted combination of the editing quality objectives:

\max_{\mathcal{F}} \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \left( \lambda_1 R_{\text{visual}}(x_{\pi(k)}, x_{\pi(k+1)}) + \lambda_2 R_{\text{rhythm}}(t_k) + \lambda_3 R_{\text{narrative}}(x_{\pi(k)}) + \lambda_4 G(x_{\pi(k)}, x_{\pi(k+1)}) \right) \right]

subject to:

· Character consistency constraints
· Style consistency constraints
· Lip-sync constraints
· Shot ordering constraints (shots must follow script order)

The expectation is over the stochasticity in generation and editing.

3.5. Decomposition into Subproblems

This global optimization problem is too complex to solve directly. We decompose it into hierarchical subproblems corresponding to the agents in CineForge AI:

Subproblem 1 (Narrative Generation): Generate a script  \mathcal{S}  that is coherent and satisfies the user prompt  P . This involves maintaining narrative state  \mathbf{h}_t  and ensuring that character arcs and plot points are resolved.

Subproblem 2 (Shot Generation): For each beat  b_{i,j} , generate a set of candidate shots  \mathcal{X}_{i,j}  that satisfy character and style consistency constraints. This involves conditioning on character embeddings  \mathbf{e}_c  and style references.

Subproblem 3 (Editing): Given the pool of shots  \mathcal{X} , select and order them to form  \mathcal{F}  that maximizes the editing objective. This is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in Section 5.3.

Subproblem 4 (Audio Synchronization): Generate and align dialogue, sound effects, and music with the final video, ensuring lip-sync and temporal alignment.

These subproblems are not independent; feedback loops allow the editing agent to request regenerations when constraints cannot be satisfied.

3.6. Summary

This chapter has provided a mathematical foundation for the long-form film generation problem. We have defined the key components of a film, formalized the constraints that a generated film must satisfy, and stated the overall optimization objective. The decomposition into subproblems establishes the structure for the CineForge AI architecture presented in the next chapter. This formalization ensures that the research questions are precisely defined and that the proposed solutions can be rigorously evaluated against quantitative metrics.

Chapter 4: Proposed Architecture: CineForge AI

4.1. Introduction

This chapter presents the complete architecture of CineForge AI, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automated long-form film generation. The architecture is designed to address the challenges identified in Chapter 2 and formalized in Chapter 3: narrative coherence across hundreds of scenes, visual consistency across thousands of independently generated shots, and intelligent editing that optimizes multiple competing objectives simultaneously.

We adopt a multi-agent approach because film production itself is fundamentally collaborative. Different stages of the process—writing, directing, editing, sound design—require specialized expertise. By decomposing the problem into agents with distinct responsibilities, we can leverage specialized models and techniques for each task while maintaining overall coherence through shared representations and feedback loops.

The chapter is organized as follows. Section 4.2 provides a high-level overview of the pipeline and the interactions between agents. Sections 4.3 through 4.6 describe each agent in detail: Narrative Agent (script generation), Visual Agent (video generation), Assembly Agent (editing), and Audio Agent (sound). Section 4.7 discusses the feedback mechanisms that enable error correction and iterative refinement. Section 4.8 summarizes the architecture and its key innovations.

4.2. Architectural Overview

CineForge AI consists of four primary agents arranged in a pipeline with feedback loops:

```

Feedback Loops:

· Assembly Agent → Visual Agent: Request regeneration of shots that fail continuity checks
· Audio Agent → Visual Agent: Request regeneration for lip-sync failures
· Assembly Agent → Narrative Agent: Request script adjustments for editing infeasibility

The agents communicate through a shared Global State that includes:

· Narrative state vector  \mathbf{h}_t  (compressed story context)
· Character identity embeddings  \mathbf{e}_c  for all principal characters
· Style embedding  \mathbf{s}  for the film's visual aesthetic
· Scene and beat metadata

4.3. Narrative Agent

The Narrative Agent is responsible for transforming a high-level user prompt into a structured, scene-by-script with beat-level granularity. It operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of long-form narrative.

4.3.1. Hierarchical Architecture

The Narrative Agent employs a three-level hierarchy:

Level 1: Plotter. The Plotter takes the user prompt  P  and generates a high-level plot outline consisting of:

· Logline (one-sentence summary)
· Character descriptions for principal characters
· Three-act structure with key plot points (inciting incident, midpoint, climax, etc.)
· Major story arcs for each character

The Plotter uses a large language model (e.g., Llama 3-70B) with few-shot prompting based on screenplay outlines. The output is a structured JSON object.

Level 2: Scene Writer. For each plot point, the Scene Writer generates one or more scenes that realize that plot point. Each scene includes:

· Scene heading (INT./EXT., location, time of day)
· Characters present
· Brief description of the scene's purpose
· Emotional tone

The Scene Writer maintains a global narrative state  \mathbf{h}  that is updated after each scene. This state is a compressed vector representation of the story so far, enabling long-range coherence. The state update function is:

\mathbf{h}_{i} = \text{GRU}(\mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \text{embed}(s_i))

where embed( s_i ) is an embedding of scene  i 's summary, and GRU is a Gated Recurrent Unit that compresses the information.

Level 3: Beat Describer. For each scene, the Beat Describer decomposes it into a sequence of beats—the smallest narrative units. Each beat corresponds to a specific story moment and includes:

· Beat description (e.g., "Detective enters the room and sees the murder weapon")
· Characters involved
· Emotional valence
· Suggested shot type (close-up, wide shot, etc.)
· Dialogue lines (if any)

The Beat Describer ensures that the total number of beats per scene is appropriate for screen duration (typically 1-3 minutes of screen time per scene, with 2-5 beats per minute).

4.3.2. Global Narrative State

The global narrative state  \mathbf{h} \in \mathbb{R}^{512}  is a critical innovation for long-form coherence. It captures:

· Current emotional states of principal characters
· Unresolved plot threads
· Important story facts established so far
· Thematic motifs

The state is updated after each scene using the GRU mentioned above. When generating scene  s_i , the Scene Writer conditions on  \mathbf{h}_{i-1}  to ensure that the new scene is consistent with established story elements. For example, if a character was injured in an earlier scene, the state vector encodes this, and the Scene Writer will ensure subsequent scenes show appropriate consequences.

The state vector is also made available to the Visual Agent and Assembly Agent, allowing them to condition their decisions on narrative context. For instance, the Assembly Agent might choose faster cutting during high-tension scenes indicated by the emotional valence in the state.

4.3.3. Character and Relationship Tracking

Beyond the compressed state vector, the Narrative Agent maintains explicit databases of:

· Character Traits: For each character, attributes like personality, goals, and secrets
· Relationships: Matrices representing relationships between characters (e.g., ally, enemy, lover)
· Character Arcs: The planned transformation for each character over the film

These are updated as the script progresses and are used to ensure that character behaviors remain consistent. For example, if two characters become romantically involved, subsequent scenes should reflect this changed relationship.

4.3.4. Output Format

The final output of the Narrative Agent is a structured script object:

```json
{
  "title": "The Time Detective",
  "logline": "...",
  "characters": [
    {"name": "Alex", "traits": {...}, "arc": "..."}
  ],
  "scenes": [
    {
      "heading": "INT. POLICE STATION - DAY",
      "summary": "Alex is called to a mysterious crime scene",
      "tone": "tense",
      "beats": [
        {
          "id": "s1b1",
          "description": "Alex enters the bullpen, other detectives nod grimly",
          "characters": ["Alex"],
          "shot_type": "wide",
          "dialogue": []
        },
        {
          "id": "s1b2",
          "description": "Captain briefs Alex on the impossible murder",
          "characters": ["Alex", "Captain"],
          "shot_type": "over-the-shoulder",
          "dialogue": [
            {"speaker": "Captain", "line": "We've got a body with no cause of death."}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This structured format is easily parsed by downstream agents.

4.4. Visual Agent

The Visual Agent is responsible for generating video clips for each beat in the script. Its primary challenges are: (1) maintaining character identity across all clips, (2) ensuring consistent visual style across the entire film, and (3) generating multiple candidate shots per beat to give the Assembly Agent choices.

4.4.1. Base Model: Latent Video Diffusion

We use a pre-trained latent video diffusion model as the backbone for generation. Specifically, we adopt Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) (Blattmann et al., 2023), which extends Stable Diffusion to video by adding temporal layers. SVD operates in the latent space of a VAE, generating video clips of up to 14 frames at a time, which can be extended via autoregressive generation.

The base model takes as input:

· A text prompt describing the desired content
· A latent noise tensor
· Optional conditioning inputs (e.g., depth maps, edges)

It outputs a denoised latent tensor, which is decoded to video frames.

4.4.2. Character Anchoring via LoRA

To ensure that each character maintains a consistent appearance across all clips, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021). For each principal character  c , we train a set of LoRA weights  \Delta_c  on a small set of reference images (5-10 images showing the character in various poses and expressions).

The LoRA weights are low-rank matrices  A_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}  and  B_c \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}  that are added to the query, key, value, and feed-forward projections in the attention layers of the diffusion model. The adapted forward pass becomes:

\text{output} = \text{base\_layer}(x) + \alpha \cdot (A_c B_c^T) x

where  \alpha  is a scaling factor (typically 0.8-1.0).

During training, only the LoRA weights are updated, while the base model remains frozen. This makes training efficient (a few hundred steps per character) and prevents catastrophic forgetting.

During inference for a beat involving character  c , we activate the corresponding LoRA weights. If multiple characters appear in the same beat, we use a weighted combination of their LoRA weights, with weights proportional to their prominence in the beat.

4.4.3. Style Consistency via ControlNet

Beyond characters, the film must maintain a consistent visual style—color palette, lighting, texture—across all scenes. We achieve this using a ControlNet conditioned on a style embedding extracted from the first generated scene.

The process is:

1. Generate Reference Scene: For the first scene of the film, we generate a set of frames without style conditioning (or with a user-provided style reference).
2. Extract Style Embedding: We pass the generated frames through a style encoder (a VGG-19 network trained for style transfer) to extract a style embedding  \mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{512} .
3. Condition All Subsequent Scenes: For all subsequent scenes, we use a ControlNet that takes the style embedding  \mathbf{s}  as input and injects it into the diffusion process. The ControlNet is trained to replicate the style of the reference frames while allowing content variation.

The style embedding captures global properties like color statistics, texture patterns, and lighting characteristics. By conditioning on this embedding, all scenes inherit the same visual aesthetic.

4.4.4. Shot Generation for Beats

For each beat  b_{i,j} , the Visual Agent generates  Q_{i,j}  candidate shots (typically 3-5). Each candidate is generated with:

· The beat description as the text prompt
· Activated LoRA weights for all characters in the beat
· Style ControlNet conditioning
· Different random seeds to produce variation

The generation process uses classifier-free guidance with guidance scale 7.5 to balance prompt adherence and diversity.

4.4.5. Quality Checking

Before passing shots to the Assembly Agent, the Visual Agent performs automatic quality checks:

1. Character Presence Verification: Using a face detection model, verify that all required characters appear in the shot. If a character is missing, the shot is discarded.
2. Character Consistency Check: Extract face embeddings from all frames containing each character and verify that the distance to the reference embedding is below threshold  \epsilon_c . If any frame exceeds the threshold, the shot is flagged for potential regeneration.
3. Technical Quality: Check for artifacts, flicker, or extreme motion blur using a pre-trained quality classifier.

Shots that fail quality checks are either regenerated with different seeds or discarded. The Assembly Agent is informed of the available candidates and their quality scores.

4.4.6. Metadata Storage

Each generated shot is stored with rich metadata to aid assembly:

```json
{
  "shot_id": "s1b2_c3",
  "beat_id": "s1b2",
  "characters_present": ["Alex", "Captain"],
  "dominant_colors": [...],
  "motion_intensity": 0.7,
  "facial_embeddings": {
    "Alex": [...],
    "Captain": [...]
  },
  "quality_score": 0.92,
  "duration_frames": 24,
  "first_frame_embedding": [...],
  "last_frame_embedding": [...]
}
```

This metadata enables the Assembly Agent to make informed decisions about shot sequencing and transitions.

4.5. Assembly Agent

The Assembly Agent is the core innovation of CineForge AI. It takes the pool of candidate shots and selects and sequences them to form a coherent film, optimizing for visual continuity, rhythmic alignment, narrative fidelity, and cinematic grammar.

4.5.1. Overview as Sequential Decision Process

We formulate editing as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). At each step, the agent observes the current state and selects a shot from the remaining candidates, along with a transition type. The goal is to maximize cumulative reward over the entire film.

The MDP is defined by:

· State space  \mathcal{S} 
· Action space  \mathcal{A} 
· Transition function  P(s' | s, a) 
· Reward function  R(s, a) 
· Discount factor  \gamma 

We describe each component below.

4.5.2. State Representation

The state at step  t  encapsulates all information needed to make editing decisions:

s_t = (v_{\text{last}}, \mathbf{h}_t, b_{\text{current}}, \mathcal{X}_{\text{remaining}}, \mathbf{a}_t)

where:

·  v_{\text{last}}  is the last few frames of the previously selected shot (or a special start token). Typically we store the last 3 frames to capture motion.
·  \mathbf{h}_t  is the current narrative state from the Narrative Agent.
·  b_{\text{current}}  is the current beat that needs to be covered (or None if between beats).
·  \mathcal{X}_{\text{remaining}}  is the set of candidate shots not yet used, grouped by beat.
·  \mathbf{a}_t  is the audio onset envelope for the upcoming few seconds (extracted from the audio track being built).

The state is represented as a concatenation of embeddings from each component, passed through a transformer encoder to capture interactions.

4.5.3. Action Space

An action  a_t  is a tuple:

a_t = (x_{\text{selected}}, \tau, t_{\text{cut}})

where:

·  x_{\text{selected}}  is a candidate shot from  \mathcal{X}_{\text{remaining}}  for the current beat (or a placeholder for a cutaway shot)
·  \tau \in \{\text{cut}, \text{fade}, \text{dissolve}, \text{wipe}, \ldots\}  is the transition type
·  t_{\text{cut}}  is the precise frame within the previous shot where the cut occurs (allowing for cuts not exactly at shot boundaries)

The action space is large but constrained: only shots from the current beat are eligible (except for cutaways, which are pre-generated establishing shots). The transition type is chosen from a small set (5-10 options).

4.5.4. Reward Function

The reward function is a weighted combination of four terms:

R(s_t, a_t) = \lambda_1 R_{\text{cont}} + \lambda_2 R_{\text{rhythm}} + \lambda_3 R_{\text{narrative}} + \lambda_4 R_{\text{grammar}}

Continuity Reward  R_{\text{cont}} : Measures visual smoothness between the end of the previous shot and the beginning of the new shot. For a cut transition:

R_{\text{cont}} = -\text{LPIPS}(f_{\text{last}}(x_{\text{prev}}, t_{\text{cut}}), f_{\text{first}}(x_{\text{selected}}))

where LPIPS is the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (lower is better). For dissolves and other transitions, we compute the LPIPS between each interpolated frame and a target blending of the two shots, averaged.

Rhythm Reward  R_{\text{rhythm}} : Encourages cuts to land on audio beats. Let  O(t)  be the onset strength envelope of the audio at time  t . Then:

R_{\text{rhythm}} = O(t_{\text{cut}})

This is computed using a super-flux onset detector on the audio track that has been generated up to this point.

Narrative Reward  R_{\text{narrative}} : Measures how well the selected shot represents its intended beat:

R_{\text{narrative}} = \text{CLIP}(x_{\text{selected}}, \text{description}(b_{\text{current}}))

where CLIP score is computed by averaging over key frames of the shot.

Grammar Reward  R_{\text{grammar}} : Penalizes violations of cinematic conventions. We train a binary classifier on pairs of shots labeled as "good edit" or "bad edit" using a dataset of professional films. The classifier takes the last frame of the previous shot and the first frame of the new shot (or the transition frames) and outputs a probability of being a good edit. The reward is:

R_{\text{grammar}} = \log(p_{\text{good}})

Common violations detected include:

· Jump cuts (shots of same subject with similar angle and scale)
· Crossing the 180-degree line
· Mismatched screen direction
· Eyeline mismatches

4.5.5. Policy Learning with Reinforcement Learning

We learn a stochastic policy  \pi_\theta(a|s)  using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). The policy network is a transformer that attends to the state components and outputs a distribution over eligible actions.

The objective is to maximize expected cumulative discounted reward:

J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_\theta} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \right]

PPO uses a clipped surrogate objective to ensure stable updates:

L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \right]

where  r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}  is the probability ratio, and  \hat{A}_t  is the advantage estimate.

4.5.6. Training Data

We train the policy on a dataset of professionally edited films. For each film, we have:

· The final edited sequence with shot boundaries
· The original raw footage (simulated by extracting shots from the final film)
· Audio track
· Script alignment (beats matched to shots)

The reward is computed using the actual edits as targets (e.g., continuity reward uses the actual next shot as the ideal). The policy learns to imitate human editors while also optimizing the reward components.

4.5.7. Transition Generation

When the selected action specifies a transition other than cut, we generate intermediate frames using frame interpolation. We use RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation) (Huang et al., 2022), which estimates optical flow between the last frame of the previous shot and the first frame of the next shot, then synthesizes intermediate frames.

For dissolves, we blend the two shots linearly over the transition duration. For wipes, we use parameterized wipe patterns (e.g., left-to-right, clock wipe) that can be rendered deterministically.

4.5.8. Handling Regeneration Requests

If the continuity reward for a chosen action falls below a threshold (indicating a poor visual match), the Assembly Agent can request that the Visual Agent regenerate the selected shot with additional constraints. The request specifies:

· The desired first frame embedding (to match the previous shot's last frame)
· The beat description
· Character LoRA weights

The Visual Agent then attempts to generate a shot that satisfies these constraints, and the Assembly Agent reevaluates. This feedback loop is crucial for achieving seamless continuity.

4.6. Audio Agent

The Audio Agent is responsible for generating and synchronizing all audio elements: dialogue, sound effects, and music. It operates after the Assembly Agent has produced a rough cut, ensuring that audio is precisely timed to the visuals.

4.6.1. Dialogue Generation and Lip-Sync

For each line of dialogue in the script, we generate speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We use Tortoise-TTS (Betts, 2022), which supports voice cloning from short samples. For each character, we either:

· Use a default voice profile
· Clone a voice from a provided sample (if available)
· Generate a synthetic voice from textual description

The TTS model outputs a waveform and phoneme-level timing information.

To synchronize lip movements with the generated audio, we apply Wav2Lip (Prajwal et al., 2020) as a post-processing step. Wav2Lip takes a video and an audio track and generates a new video with lip movements synchronized to the audio. It works by:

1. Extracting the mouth region from each frame
2. Generating a lip-sync error signal
3. Adjusting the mouth region via a generative model

We apply Wav2Lip to each shot containing dialogue, using the generated TTS audio. The model runs in real-time and preserves the rest of the frame.

4.6.2. Sound Effects

Sound effects are generated based on the beat descriptions. For common sounds (footsteps, doors closing, gunshots), we maintain a library of high-quality sound effects. For novel sounds, we use a text-to-audio model like AudioLDM (Liu et al., 2023), which generates audio from text descriptions.

Sound effects are timed to specific frames. The beat description may specify, for example, "Alex slams the door." The Audio Agent detects the frame where the door-slamming action occurs (using motion analysis) and places the sound effect at that exact moment.

4.6.3. Music Scoring

The musical score is generated by MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023), a text-to-music model that can generate high-quality, coherent music from descriptions. The description is derived from the narrative state and the emotional tone of each scene:

· "Tense, rhythmic electronic music with a driving bassline"
· "Melancholic piano solo, slow tempo"
· "Triumphant orchestral swell"

The generated music is timed to match the pacing of the edited video. We extract beat locations from the music and adjust the editing rhythm reward accordingly (this creates a feedback loop where music and editing co-adapt).

4.6.4. Audio Mixing

All audio elements are mixed using standard audio processing techniques:

· Dialogue is centered and normalized
· Sound effects are panned according to on-screen position
· Music is mixed at lower volume during dialogue (ducking)
· Overall loudness is normalized to broadcast standards

The final audio track is rendered and multiplexed with the video to produce the completed film.

4.7. Feedback Loops and Iterative Refinement

A key innovation of CineForge AI is the incorporation of feedback loops that allow later-stage agents to request refinements from earlier stages. This enables the system to correct errors and improve coherence iteratively.

4.7.1. Assembly → Visual Feedback

The most critical feedback loop is from Assembly to Visual. When the Assembly Agent evaluates a candidate shot and finds that its continuity reward is too low (indicating a poor visual match with the previous shot), it can request a regeneration with specific constraints.

The regeneration request includes:

· Target first frame embedding: The embedding of the previous shot's last frame, which the new shot's first frame should match
· Beat description: The original description, possibly augmented with additional details (e.g., "same lighting, character facing left")
· Character LoRA weights: As before

The Visual Agent then attempts to generate a shot that satisfies these constraints by:

1. Using the target embedding as a conditioning signal in the diffusion process (via a small adapter network)
2. Sampling multiple seeds and selecting the best match
3. If no shot meets the threshold after several attempts, falling back to a cutaway shot

This feedback loop is computationally expensive but crucial for achieving seamless continuity.

4.7.2. Audio → Visual Feedback

If the lip-sync quality for a dialogue shot falls below threshold (measured by the confidence of a lip-sync detector), the Audio Agent can request regeneration. The request specifies the audio waveform, and the Visual Agent generates a new version of the shot with Wav2Lip applied during generation (rather than as a post-process), which can yield better results.

4.7.3. Assembly → Narrative Feedback

In rare cases, the Assembly Agent may find that no combination of shots can adequately cover a beat (e.g., the beat description is too abstract to visualize). It can then request that the Narrative Agent revise the script, either by splitting the beat into more concrete sub-beats or by providing more specific visual descriptions.

This feedback loop is invoked sparingly, as it requires regenerating the script and potentially all associated shots.

4.8. Summary

This chapter has presented the complete architecture of CineForge AI. The key innovations are:

1. Hierarchical Narrative Generation with a global narrative state that maintains long-range coherence across hundreds of scenes.
2. Character Anchoring via LoRA that preserves identity across independently generated shots by activating character-specific weights during diffusion.
3. Style Consistency via ControlNet that propagates a consistent visual aesthetic throughout the film.
4. MDP-Based Editing Formulation that treats shot selection and sequencing as a sequential decision problem optimized via reinforcement learning.
5. Multi-Component Reward Function that balances visual continuity, rhythmic alignment, narrative fidelity, and cinematic grammar.
6. Feedback Loops that enable iterative refinement and error correction across agents.

The architecture addresses all five research gaps identified in Chapter 2 and provides a concrete framework for implementing the mathematical formulations of Chapter 3. The following chapter delves into the mathematical details of each component.

Chapter 5: Mathematical Modeling

5.1. Introduction

This chapter provides the mathematical foundations for the CineForge AI architecture. We derive the formal models underlying each agent, including the narrative state representation, latent space anchoring for character consistency, the Markov Decision Process for editing, the reinforcement learning objective, audio-visual alignment algorithms, and the composite evaluation metric. The mathematical formulations presented here enable precise implementation and quantitative evaluation.

5.2. Narrative State Representation and Update

5.2.1. Narrative State Vector

We represent the narrative state at scene  i  as a continuous vector  \mathbf{h}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_n} . This vector encodes all information necessary for future coherence: character states, unresolved plot threads, emotional tone, and thematic elements.

The state is initialized from the user prompt and character descriptions:

\mathbf{h}_0 = \text{Encoder}(P, \{\text{char}_c\}_{c=1}^{C})

where Encoder is a transformer-based model that compresses the input into a fixed-dimensional vector.

5.2.2. State Update Mechanism

After each scene  s_i , the state is updated using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):

\mathbf{h}_i = \text{GRU}(\mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \mathbf{e}(s_i))

where  \mathbf{e}(s_i) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_e}  is an embedding of scene  s_i 's summary and key events.

The GRU update equations are:

\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{z}_i &= \sigma(W_z \mathbf{e}(s_i) + U_z \mathbf{h}_{i-1} + b_z) \\
\mathbf{r}_i &= \sigma(W_r \mathbf{e}(s_i) + U_r \mathbf{h}_{i-1} + b_r) \\
\tilde{\mathbf{h}}_i &= \tanh(W_h \mathbf{e}(s_i) + U_h (\mathbf{r}_i \odot \mathbf{h}_{i-1}) + b_h) \\
\mathbf{h}_i &= (1 - \mathbf{z}_i) \odot \mathbf{h}_{i-1} + \mathbf{z}_i \odot \tilde{\mathbf{h}}_i
\end{aligned}

where  \odot  denotes element-wise multiplication, and  \sigma  is the sigmoid function. The update gate  \mathbf{z}_i  controls how much of the previous state to retain, while the reset gate  \mathbf{r}_i  determines how to combine new information with the old state.

5.2.3. Scene Embedding

The scene embedding  \mathbf{e}(s_i)  is computed from multiple components:

\mathbf{e}(s_i) = \text{Concat}(\mathbf{e}_{\text{loc}}(l_i), \mathbf{e}_{\text{char}}(\mathcal{C}_i), \mathbf{e}_{\text{summary}}(s_i))

where:

·  \mathbf{e}_{\text{loc}}(l_i)  is an embedding of the location (learned)
·  \mathbf{e}_{\text{char}}(\mathcal{C}_i)  is the average of character embeddings for characters present
·  \mathbf{e}_{\text{summary}}(s_i)  is a sentence embedding (e.g., from Sentence-BERT) of the scene's summary text

5.2.4. State Conditioning for Generation

When generating scene  s_i , the Scene Writer conditions on  \mathbf{h}_{i-1}  through cross-attention:

\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V

where the query comes from the current generation context, and the key/value come from the state vector  \mathbf{h}_{i-1}  projected to appropriate dimensions.

This ensures that each new scene is generated with full awareness of the story so far.

5.3. Latent Space Anchoring for Character Consistency

5.3.1. Diffusion Model Preliminaries

We consider a latent diffusion model that operates on latents  \mathbf{z} = \mathcal{E}(x) , where  \mathcal{E}  is a VAE encoder. The forward diffusion process adds noise over  T  timesteps:

q(\mathbf{z}_t | \mathbf{z}_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \mathbf{z}_{t-1}, \beta_t \mathbf{I})

The reverse process is learned:

p_\theta(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} | \mathbf{z}_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t))

Typically, the model is trained to predict the noise  \epsilon  added at each step:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{diff}} = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{p}) \|^2 \right]

where  \mathbf{p}  is the text prompt embedding.

5.3.2. LoRA for Character Adaptation

For each character  c , we learn LoRA weights that modify the attention projections. Let  W_q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_k}  be the query projection matrix in an attention layer. The adapted weights are:

W_q' = W_q + \frac{\alpha}{r} A_c B_c^T

where  A_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times r} ,  B_c \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d_k} ,  r \ll d_{\text{model}}  is the LoRA rank, and  \alpha  is a scaling factor. The same adaptation is applied to key, value, and feed-forward projections.

During training for character  c , we freeze the base model  \theta  and only update  \{A_c, B_c\}  for all layers. The loss is the standard diffusion loss computed on images of character  c :

\mathcal{L}_{\text{LoRA}}^c = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}_0 \sim p_{\text{data}}^c, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_{\theta + \Delta_c}(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{p}) \|^2 \right]

where  p_{\text{data}}^c  is the distribution of images containing character  c .

5.3.3. Face Embedding Regularization

To further enforce consistency, we add a regularization term that minimizes the distance between face embeddings of the same character across different generations. Let  \phi(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_f}  be a face recognition embedding (e.g., from ArcFace) extracted from image  \mathbf{x} .

For a batch of generated images  \{\mathbf{x}^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^B  of character  c , we compute:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{face}}^c = \frac{1}{B^2} \sum_{j=1}^B \sum_{k=1}^B \| \phi(\mathbf{x}^{(j)}) - \phi(\mathbf{x}^{(k)}) \|_2^2

This loss encourages all generated images of character  c  to have similar face embeddings.

The total loss for character  c  is:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}^c = \mathcal{L}_{\text{LoRA}}^c + \lambda_{\text{face}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{face}}^c

5.3.4. Multi-Character Generation

When generating a shot with multiple characters, we combine their LoRA weights. For layer  l , the combined adaptation is:

\Delta_{\text{combined}} = \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} w_c \Delta_c

where  w_c  are weights proportional to the character's prominence in the shot (e.g., based on speaking lines or screen presence). This linear combination in weight space approximates the effect of generating with multiple character concepts simultaneously.

5.3.5. Style Embedding via ControlNet

For style consistency, we train a ControlNet that takes a style embedding  \mathbf{s}  as input. The ControlNet copies the encoder blocks of the diffusion U-Net and adds zero-initialized convolutions that project the style embedding into the feature maps.

Formally, let  \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{p})  be the base model. The ControlNet adds a conditioning path:

\epsilon_{\theta, \phi}(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{s}) = \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{p}) + \mathcal{F}_\phi(\mathbf{z}_t, t, \mathbf{s})

where  \mathcal{F}_\phi  is the ControlNet with parameters  \phi . The ControlNet is trained on pairs of images with the same style, using the base model frozen.

5.4. Markov Decision Process for Shot Sequencing

5.4.1. Formal MDP Definition

We define the editing MDP as a tuple  (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma) .

State Space  \mathcal{S} : A state  s \in \mathcal{S}  is represented as:

s = (\mathbf{v}_{\text{last}}, \mathbf{h}, \mathbf{b}, \mathcal{X}_{\text{rem}}, \mathbf{a})

where:

·  \mathbf{v}_{\text{last}} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times H \times W \times 3}  is the tensor of the last 3 frames of the previous shot (or zeros for initial state)
·  \mathbf{h} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_n}  is the narrative state
·  \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_b}  is an embedding of the current beat description
·  \mathcal{X}_{\text{rem}}  is a set representation of remaining shots (each shot has an embedding  \mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x} )
·  \mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{T_a}  is the audio onset envelope for the next  T_a  seconds (sampled at 100Hz)

The state embedding is computed by a transformer that processes these components:

\mathbf{s} = \text{Transformer}([\mathbf{v}_{\text{last}}; \mathbf{h}; \mathbf{b}; \text{mean}(\mathcal{X}_{\text{rem}}); \mathbf{a}])

Action Space  \mathcal{A} : An action is a tuple  a = (k, \tau, \delta)  where:

·  k  is an index into  \mathcal{X}_{\text{rem}}  selecting a shot
·  \tau \in \{\text{cut}, \text{fade}, \text{dissolve}, \text{wipe}\}  is the transition type
·  \delta \in \{0, 1, \ldots, \Delta_{\text{max}}\}  is the cut offset (number of frames from the end of the previous shot to cut)

Not all actions are valid; we define a mask  \mathcal{M}(s)  that excludes actions where the selected shot is not from the current beat (except for cutaways).

Transition Function  P(s' | s, a) : The transition is deterministic given the action:

1. The selected shot  x_k  is removed from  \mathcal{X}_{\text{rem}} 
2. The last frames become the last frames of  x_k 
3. The narrative state advances if the beat is completed
4. The beat advances to the next beat if all shots for current beat are used
5. The audio envelope updates to reflect the time elapsed

Reward Function  R(s, a) : As defined in Section 4.5.4.

Discount Factor  \gamma : We use  \gamma = 0.99  to encourage long-term planning.

5.4.2. Reward Function Components

Continuity Reward: For a cut with offset  \delta , let  f_{\text{prev}}  be the frame at position  -\delta  from the end of the previous shot, and  f_{\text{next}}  be the first frame of the new shot. Then:

R_{\text{cont}} = -\text{LPIPS}(f_{\text{prev}}, f_{\text{next}})

For dissolves, we generate  M  interpolated frames  \{\hat{f}_m\}_{m=1}^M  using RIFE. Let  f_{\text{target}, m}  be the linear blend of the two shots at the corresponding time. Then:

R_{\text{cont}} = -\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \text{LPIPS}(\hat{f}_m, f_{\text{target}, m})

Rhythm Reward: Let  O(t)  be the onset strength at time  t  (in seconds). The cut time  t_{\text{cut}}  is determined by the offset  \delta  and the frame rate. Then:

R_{\text{rhythm}} = O(t_{\text{cut}})

The onset strength is computed using a super-flux detector on the audio track. For computational efficiency, we precompute  O(t)  for the entire audio track.

Narrative Reward: Let CLIP (x, b)  be the CLIP similarity between the shot's visual content and the beat description, averaged over key frames:

R_{\text{narrative}} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K \text{CLIP}(f_{\text{key}, k}, \text{desc}(b))

Grammar Reward: We train a binary classifier  g(f_{\text{prev}}, f_{\text{next}})  that outputs the probability of a good edit. The classifier is a convolutional neural network that takes the two frames concatenated channel-wise. Then:

R_{\text{grammar}} = \log(g(f_{\text{prev}}, f_{\text{next}}))

5.4.3. Policy Network Architecture

The policy  \pi_\theta(a|s)  is a transformer-based network. It consists of:

1. Input Projection: Each state component is projected to dimension  d_{\text{model}} 
2. Transformer Encoder: 6 layers of multi-head self-attention with positional encoding
3. Action Head: A linear layer that outputs logits for each valid action (masked)
4. Value Head: A linear layer that outputs the state value  V(s) 

The policy outputs a probability distribution over actions:

\pi_\theta(a|s) = \frac{\exp(\text{logits}_a)}{\sum_{a' \in \mathcal{M}(s)} \exp(\text{logits}_{a'})}

5.4.4. Training with PPO

We train using Proximal Policy Optimization. The loss function is:

L^{\text{PPO}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) - c_1 L^{\text{VF}}(\theta) + c_2 S[\pi_\theta](s_t) \right]

where:

·  L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) 
·  r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)} 
·  L^{\text{VF}}(\theta) = (V_\theta(s_t) - V_t^{\text{target}})^2 
·  S[\pi_\theta](s_t)  is the entropy bonus to encourage exploration
·  c_1, c_2  are coefficients (typically  c_1 = 0.5, c_2 = 0.01 )

The advantage  \hat{A}_t  is computed using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE):

\hat{A}_t = \sum_{l=0}^{T-t-1} (\gamma \lambda)^l \delta_{t+l}

where  \delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) .

5.5. Audio-Visual Alignment

5.5.1. Onset Detection for Rhythm

The onset strength envelope  O(t)  is computed from the audio waveform using a spectrogram-based approach:

1. Compute the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with window size 1024 samples and hop length 512 samples (at 44.1kHz, this gives ~11.6ms resolution).
2. Compute the spectral flux:  SF(t) = \sum_f \max(0, |X(t,f)| - |X(t-1,f)|) 
3. Apply a moving average filter for smoothing
4. Normalize to [0, 1]

The result is  O(t)  sampled at the STFT hop rate. We upsample to match video frame rate via linear interpolation.

5.5.2. Lip-Sync Alignment

Wav2Lip operates by generating a lip-synchronized video  \hat{V}  from an input video  V  and audio  A . The model minimizes:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{Wav2Lip}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{L1}}(\hat{V}, V) + \lambda_{\text{sync}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{sync}}(\hat{V}, A)

where  \mathcal{L}_{\text{sync}}  is a pretrained sync loss that measures the alignment between lip movements and audio.

For our purposes, we apply Wav2Lip as a post-process. However, if regeneration is requested, we can incorporate the sync loss into the diffusion model's training objective.

5.5.3. Sound Effect Timing

For a sound effect associated with an action at frame  f_{\text{action}} , we place the sound at that exact frame. The Audio Agent detects action frames using optical flow magnitude. For a given beat description, we identify the frame with maximum motion in the relevant region (e.g., the door region for "slams the door").

5.6. Composite Evaluation Metrics

5.6.1. Narrative Coherence Metric

We define narrative coherence  Q_{\text{narrative}}  as the BERTScore between a generated script summary and a human-authored reference summary (when available) or between the generated script and itself at different points (self-consistency).

For self-consistency, we sample two summaries of the same script from different points and compute:

Q_{\text{narrative}} = \text{BERTScore}(\text{summary}_1, \text{summary}_2)

This measures whether the script maintains a consistent story.

5.6.2. Visual Consistency Metric

Visual consistency has two components: character consistency and temporal smoothness.

Character Consistency: For each character  c , let  \{\mathbf{e}_{c}^{(j)}\}_{j=1}^{N_c}  be the face embeddings extracted from all frames where character  c  appears. Then:

Q_{\text{char}} = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{c=1}^C \left(1 - \frac{\sigma(\{\mathbf{e}_{c}^{(j)}\})}{\sigma_{\text{max}}}\right)

where  \sigma  is the standard deviation of embeddings (computed as the mean pairwise distance), and  \sigma_{\text{max}}  is a normalizing constant (the maximum expected deviation).

Temporal Smoothness: For each consecutive frame pair  (f_t, f_{t+1})  in the final film:

Q_{\text{smooth}} = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} (1 - \text{LPIPS}(f_t, f_{t+1}))

The overall visual consistency is:

Q_{\text{visual}} = \alpha_{\text{char}} Q_{\text{char}} + (1-\alpha_{\text{char}}) Q_{\text{smooth}}

5.6.3. Editing Quality Metric

Editing quality combines rhythm and grammar:

Q_{\text{editing}} = \beta_{\text{rhythm}} \left( \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K O(t_k) \right) + (1-\beta_{\text{rhythm}}) \left( \frac{1}{K-1} \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} g(f_{\text{last},k}, f_{\text{first},k+1}) \right)

where  g  is the grammar classifier probability.

5.6.4. Audio-Visual Alignment Metric

For dialogue shots, we measure lip-sync accuracy using a pretrained sync confidence model  \text{SyncConf}(V, A) \in [0,1] . For the entire film:

Q_{\text{audio}} = \frac{1}{D} \sum_{d=1}^D \text{SyncConf}(V_d, A_d)

where  D  is the number of dialogue segments.

5.6.5. Composite Score

The overall quality score is:

Q = w_1 Q_{\text{narrative}} + w_2 Q_{\text{visual}} + w_3 Q_{\text{editing}} + w_4 Q_{\text{audio}}

with weights  w_i  summing to 1. These weights are calibrated by maximizing correlation with human ratings in user studies.

Chapter 7: Experimental Design

7.1. Introduction

This chapter presents the experimental design for evaluating the CineForge AI framework. While no experiments have been conducted at this stage, we provide a comprehensive plan for empirical validation, specifying research hypotheses, evaluation protocols, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies. This design establishes a rigorous methodology for assessing the framework's performance against the objectives stated in Chapter 1 and the mathematical formulations in Chapter 5.

The experimental design is organized as follows. Section 7.2 states the research hypotheses to be tested. Section 7.3 describes the datasets and benchmarks for evaluation. Section 7.4 specifies baseline methods for comparison. Section 7.5 details the evaluation protocols, including quantitative metrics and user studies. Section 7.6 outlines ablation studies to isolate component contributions. Section 7.7 addresses statistical considerations. Section 7.8 summarizes the experimental design.

7.2. Research Hypotheses

The experimental evaluation is designed to test the following hypotheses, derived from the research questions in Chapter 1:

7.2.1. Narrative Coherence Hypotheses

H1: The hierarchical narrative agent with global state produces scripts with higher narrative coherence than a flat LLM baseline.

H1a: The global narrative state reduces character inconsistencies (e.g., forgetting character traits, contradicting established facts).

H1b: The hierarchical structure (plot → scenes → beats) produces better scene transitions and pacing than end-to-end generation.

7.2.2. Visual Consistency Hypotheses

H2: LoRA-based character anchoring reduces character drift across independently generated shots compared to baseline methods.

H2a: The face embedding regularization loss further improves consistency beyond LoRA alone.

H2b: Style ControlNet conditioning maintains consistent visual aesthetics across scenes.

H2c: The combined approach (LoRA + style conditioning) achieves visual consistency approaching that of human-crafted films.

7.2.3. Editing Quality Hypotheses

H3: The RL-based editing policy produces shot sequences with higher editing quality than heuristic or supervised baselines.

H3a: The multi-component reward function (continuity + rhythm + narrative + grammar) yields better results than any single component alone.

H3b: The learned policy generalizes to unseen films and shot pools.

H3c: Human viewers prefer edits selected by the RL policy over baseline methods.

7.2.4. Audio-Visual Alignment Hypotheses

H4: The integrated audio pipeline produces lip-sync accuracy comparable to human-dubbed content.

H4a: Rhythm-based cut alignment improves perceived editing quality.

H4b: Scene-appropriate music generation enhances narrative engagement.

7.2.5. Overall Quality Hypotheses

H5: The complete CineForge AI pipeline generates films that human viewers rate as coherent, consistent, and engaging.

H5a: The composite evaluation metric correlates strongly with human judgments.

H5b: Each component ablation reduces overall quality, validating the multi-agent architecture.

7.8. Summary

This chapter has presented a comprehensive experimental design for evaluating the CineForge AI framework. The design includes:

· Research hypotheses covering all aspects of the framework
· Evaluation datasets for script generation, character consistency, editing, and full films
· Baseline methods for comparison at each stage
· Quantitative metrics and user study protocols for thorough evaluation
· Ablation studies to isolate component contributions

This experimental design provides a roadmap for empirical validation once the system is implemented. The combination of quantitative metrics and human evaluation will provide strong evidence for or against the research hypotheses, and the ablation studies will quantify the contribution of each architectural innovation.

The next chapter will present the results of these experiments (to be completed after implementation). For now, this design stands as a specification for future work.
