Systemic Aging Control Theory: 

A Minimal Mathematical Model of Senescence Propagation and Its Empirical Anchoring in HMGB1 Biology

Abstract

Aging is characterized by a progressive, nonlinear decline in physiological function, suggesting the involvement of positive feedback loops rather than linear damage accumulation alone. Cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) constitute one such candidate loop: senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors that can induce senescence in bystander cells, potentially propagating aging systemically. This thesis develops and analyzes a minimal mathematical framework—Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT)—to explore the dynamical consequences of such feedback. The model comprises four ordinary differential equations representing molecular damage, senescent burden, a circulating SASP signal, and systemic inflammation.

We first review the evidence that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern, exhibits the properties required to instantiate the model’s signal variable: it is secreted by senescent cells, elevated in aged circulation, and capable of inducing senescence in vitro. We then provide a complete mathematical analysis of the linear skeleton, proving that a transcritical bifurcation separates a stable healthy equilibrium from an unbounded‑growth regime, with the bifurcation parameter being the immune clearance rate of senescent cells. Using published quantitative data, we anchor each model parameter within biologically plausible ranges and perform global sensitivity analysis to demonstrate robustness.

Within this empirically grounded parameter space, the model predicts: (i) a critical threshold in senescent burden beyond which spontaneous recovery is impossible; (ii) a narrow therapeutic window for senolytic interventions, such that early treatment yields durable reset whereas late treatment yields only transient reduction; and (iii) strong synergy between senolytics and HMGB1 neutralization, enabling efficacy even in advanced age. These predictions are translated into detailed experimental protocols, rendering the framework empirically falsifiable.

The SACT model is not presented as a validated representation of aging, but as a formal hypothesis—a logical map that clarifies assumptions, exposes gaps in quantitative knowledge, and generates precise, testable predictions. All code is provided as an open‑source community resource. This thesis thus demonstrates how minimal dynamical models can serve as rigorous tools for hypothesis development in geroscience.

Chapter 1: Systemic Aging Control Theory – A Mathematical Framework for Coupled Feedback Dynamics

---

Chapter Abstract

This chapter develops a minimal mathematical model to explore the logical consequences of a hypothesized positive feedback loop in biological aging. The model is motivated by experimental observations (detailed in Chapter 2) that senescent cells secrete HMGB1, which can induce senescence in bystander cells, and that circulating HMGB1 levels correlate with age. To examine whether such a feedback architecture can, in principle, generate nonlinear transitions and intervention windows reminiscent of gerontological findings, we formulate a system of four ordinary differential equations representing: accumulated molecular damage (D), senescent cell burden (S), a circulating senescence‑associated signal (H, e.g., HMGB1), and systemic inflammation (I). The equations are deliberately linear except for coupling terms, allowing exact steady‑state and stability analysis. We identify a dimensionless feedback strength R and a clearance rate \delta; the system exhibits a transcritical bifurcation at \delta = R. For \delta > R a unique stable equilibrium exists; for \delta < R the linear system has no non‑negative steady state and S diverges. When a simple nonlinear saturation is added, the system becomes bistable, with coexisting low‑S and high‑S attractors. We analyze the response to pulsed reductions of S (analogous to senolytic treatment) and show that efficacy depends critically on the timing relative to the accumulation of the feedback variables H and I. Early pulses produce prolonged suppression; late pulses are rapidly reversed unless combined with reduction of the feedback strength. All analyses are reproducible via open‑source Python code. The model is presented as a formal skeleton – a null model for senescence propagation – and is intended as a conceptual tool for hypothesis generation, not as a validated representation of aging.

1.1 Introduction

Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, manifesting as increased morbidity and mortality [1]. Among the proposed hallmarks of aging, cellular senescence has emerged as a particularly plausible driver because senescent cells accumulate with age and their selective removal in mice delays multiple age‑related pathologies [2,3]. Senescent cells secrete a complex mixture of cytokines, chemokines, and damage‑associated molecular patterns – the senescence‑associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [4]. Several SASP factors, including HMGB1, IL‑6, and IL‑1β, can induce senescence in naïve cells in culture, suggesting the existence of a paracrine propagation loop [5,6].

If such propagation operates systemically, it could explain three puzzling features of late‑life decline:

1. Nonlinear acceleration – mortality rates double every ∼8 years in humans [7], a pattern more consistent with positive feedback than with linear damage accumulation.
2. Limited efficacy of late‑life interventions – senolytic drugs improve healthspan in aged mice, but effects are often transient and require repeated dosing [8,9].
3. Systemic nature – heterochronic parabiosis experiments show that factors in old blood can accelerate aging in young animals, and vice versa [10].

These observations motivate a dynamical systems perspective: aging may not be merely the sum of independent damage processes, but rather the behaviour of a coupled network of feedback loops. However, while the molecular components of senescence‑associated feedback are increasingly well characterized, a quantitative framework that links local interactions to organism‑level trajectories is largely absent.

This chapter addresses that gap. We do not claim to have discovered “the true model of aging”. Instead, we construct a minimal mathematical skeleton – a deliberately simplified system of ordinary differential equations – that captures the essential coupling between senescent cells and a circulating SASP signal. Our goal is to explore the logical consequences of such coupling: what dynamical phenomena are inevitable given this architecture? Under what conditions does the system exhibit tipping points, bistability, or sensitivity to the timing of perturbations?

The model is intentionally abstract. Variables are named after biological quantities (senescent burden S, systemic signal H, inflammation I, damage D) to maintain a clear connection to the motivating experiments, but the parameters are not calibrated to empirical data. The mathematical analysis is exact for the linear core; nonlinear extensions are introduced only to illustrate how the skeleton can be elaborated. All code is provided as an open‑source repository to facilitate reuse, modification, and falsification.

The chapter is organized as follows. §1.2 defines the state variables and governing equations, including a discussion of dimensional consistency and parameter choices. §1.3 presents the steady‑state analysis, derives the critical bifurcation condition, and proves stability via eigenvalue analysis. §1.4 examines time‑dependent behaviour, focusing on the effects of initial conditions and pulsed perturbations. §1.5 introduces a nonlinear saturation term to demonstrate bistability. §1.6 discusses the model’s limitations, its relationship to the experimental work in Chapter 2, and its role as a hypothesis‑generating tool. Appendices provide detailed derivations and numerical methods.

1.2 Model Formulation

1.2.1 State Variables

We define four non‑negative, continuous variables. The names are chosen to reflect the biological motivation, but the mathematics does not depend on the accuracy of these interpretations.

Symbol Name Informal interpretation Dimensions
D Damage Cumulative molecular damage (oxidative, glycative, etc.) dimensionless
S Senescent burden Fraction of cells expressing a senescence marker dimensionless
H Systemic signal Concentration of a circulating SASP factor (e.g., HMGB1) arbitrary concentration units [C]
I Inflammation Composite index of systemic pro‑inflammatory activity dimensionless

Dimensionless quantities are used for D, S, and I; H retains its own concentration unit to maintain dimensional transparency in the equations. Normalisation is arbitrary and does not affect the qualitative dynamics.

1.2.2 Governing Equations

We propose the following coupled ordinary differential equations:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dD}{dt} &= \omega - \tau D \tag{1.1} \\[4pt]
\frac{dS}{dt} &= \alpha D + \beta H + \gamma I - \delta S \tag{1.2} \\[4pt]
\frac{dH}{dt} &= \kappa S - \lambda H \tag{1.3} \\[4pt]
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \rho S + \sigma H - \mu I \tag{1.4}
\end{aligned}

All parameters are non‑negative constants. The equations are linear with respect to the state variables, except for the product terms that couple them. This linearity is a deliberate choice – it enables exact analytical treatment and isolates the effects of feedback from nonlinear saturation.

Equation (1.1): Damage dynamics.
Damage accumulates at a constant rate \omega (metabolic by‑products, imperfect repair, environmental insults) and is removed or repaired at rate \tau. This submodel represents the slow, stochastic “wear and tear” that initiates the cascade.

Equation (1.2): Senescence dynamics.
The net rate of change of senescent burden is the sum of four terms:

· Damage‑induced senescence (\alpha D): oxidative stress, DNA breaks, etc., trigger p16/p21 activation.
· Paracrine/endocrine induction (\beta H): circulating SASP factors promote senescence in distant cells.
· Inflammation‑driven senescence (\gamma I): pro‑inflammatory cytokines can induce senescence via ROS and epigenetic mechanisms.
· Immune clearance (-\delta S): NK cells, macrophages, and other effectors eliminate senescent cells.

The parameters \beta and \gamma quantify the strength of the two positive feedback pathways; \delta is the net clearance rate.

Equation (1.3): Systemic signal dynamics.
Senescent cells secrete the circulating signal at rate \kappa per unit senescent burden. The signal is cleared from circulation with rate constant \lambda (half‑life t_{1/2} = \ln 2 / \lambda).

Equation (1.4): Inflammation dynamics.
Systemic inflammation is driven by two sources: direct secretion from senescent cells (\rho S) and activation by the circulating signal (\sigma H). Inflammation decays with rate \mu.

1.2.3 Dimensional Consistency

To ensure the equations are dimensionally homogeneous, each term must have the same dimensions as the left‑hand side derivative. Table 1.1 lists the dimensions of all parameters.

Table 1.1: Dimensions of model parameters

Parameter Dimensions Interpretation
\omega [T]⁻¹ Damage accumulation rate
\tau [T]⁻¹ Damage repair rate
\alpha [T]⁻¹ Damage → S conversion
\beta [C]⁻¹[T]⁻¹ Signal → S induction
\gamma [T]⁻¹ Inflammation → S induction
\delta [T]⁻¹ Clearance rate of S
\kappa [C][T]⁻¹ S → H secretion rate
\lambda [T]⁻¹ H clearance rate
\rho [T]⁻¹ S → I induction
\sigma [C]⁻¹[T]⁻¹ H → I induction
\mu [T]⁻¹ I clearance rate

([C] denotes the arbitrary concentration unit of H.) The choice of numerical values for simulation is discussed in §1.2.4.

1.2.4 Parameter Values

Because this is a conceptual model, we do not calibrate parameters to experimental data. For numerical illustrations we select a baseline set (Table 1.2) that yields clearly visible dynamics. These values are arbitrary; the qualitative conclusions (bifurcation, pulse‑timing sensitivity, synergy) are robust to moderate variations, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis in Appendix 1.A.

Table 1.2: Baseline parameter values (arbitrary units, with [T] = day, [C] = ng/mL equivalent)

Param Value Param Value
\omega 0.02 \delta 0.12
\tau 0.01 \kappa 0.5
\alpha 0.10 \lambda 0.8
\beta 0.15 \rho 0.4
\gamma 0.10 \sigma 0.2
  \mu 0.6

Note: These parameters are not derived from experiments. They are chosen only to produce interpretable trajectories within a 100‑day simulation window. Any correspondence to real biological timescales is coincidental.

1.3 Mathematical Analysis

1.3.1 Steady States

Setting the left‑hand sides of (1.1)–(1.4) to zero gives the equilibrium conditions:

D^* = \frac{\omega}{\tau} \tag{1.5}

H^* = \frac{\kappa}{\lambda} S^* \tag{1.6}

I^* = \frac{\rho S^* + \sigma H^*}{\mu} = \frac{\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda}{\mu} S^* \tag{1.7}

Substituting (1.5)–(1.7) into (1.2):

0 = \alpha \frac{\omega}{\tau} + \beta \frac{\kappa}{\lambda} S^* + \gamma \frac{\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda}{\mu} S^* - \delta S^*

Define the effective feedback coefficient

R = \frac{\beta \kappa}{\lambda} + \frac{\gamma (\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda)}{\mu} \tag{1.8}

Then

(\delta - R) S^* = \alpha \frac{\omega}{\tau} \tag{1.9}

If \delta \neq R,

S^* = \frac{\alpha \omega / \tau}{\delta - R} \tag{1.10}

If \delta = R, equation (1.9) reduces to 0 = \alpha \omega / \tau, which is impossible for positive parameters. Hence no finite steady state exists when \delta = R.

1.3.2 Existence and Non‑Negativity

· Case \delta > R: S^* is positive and finite. All other variables are then positive by (1.5)–(1.7). This is a biologically admissible steady state (low S if \delta - R is sufficiently large).
· Case \delta < R: S^* would be negative, which is not permissible because S represents a fraction of cells. Since the differential equations preserve non‑negativity (see Appendix 1.B), the system cannot converge to a negative value; instead, it has no non‑negative equilibrium. Trajectories increase without bound (within the linear model) – the feedback overwhelms clearance.
· Case \delta = R: The system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation. The stable node from \delta > R collides with an unstable node and exchanges stability; for \delta < R the only remnant is the unstable branch, and all trajectories diverge.

The parameter \delta thus acts as a bifurcation parameter, with critical value \delta_c = R.

Figure 1.1 (schematic) shows the bifurcation diagram. For \delta > \delta_c, a unique stable equilibrium exists at low S. As \delta decreases toward \delta_c, the equilibrium value increases. At \delta = \delta_c, the stable and unstable equilibria merge and annihilate; for \delta < \delta_c, no finite equilibrium exists and S grows without bound.

(Placeholder: actual figure generated from code.)

1.3.3 Linear Stability Analysis

The system (1.1)–(1.4) is affine linear: \dot{\mathbf{x}} = J\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}, where \mathbf{x} = (D,S,H,I)^\top. The Jacobian matrix J is constant:

J = \begin{pmatrix}
-\tau & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\alpha & -\delta & \beta & \gamma \\
0 & \kappa & -\lambda & 0 \\
0 & \rho & \sigma & -\mu
\end{pmatrix}

The fixed point \mathbf{x}^* = -J^{-1}\mathbf{b} exists and is unique when \delta \neq R. Its stability is determined by the eigenvalues of J (the linear part is independent of the equilibrium because the system is affine).

J is block lower‑triangular; one eigenvalue is -\tau (negative). The remaining 3 \times 3 submatrix J_{S,H,I} governs the dynamics of (S,H,I):

J_{S,H,I} = \begin{pmatrix}
-\delta & \beta & \gamma \\
\kappa & -\lambda & 0 \\
\rho & \sigma & -\mu
\end{pmatrix}

Theorem 1.1 (Stability condition). The equilibrium \mathbf{x}^* is locally asymptotically stable if and only if \delta > R.

Proof. The matrix J_{S,H,I} is cooperative (all off‑diagonal entries are non‑negative). For cooperative systems, the eigenvalue with the largest real part is real and satisfies the characteristic equation derived from the Perron‑Frobenius theorem [11]. One can show that this eigenvalue, \xi_{\max}, is given implicitly by

\xi_{\max} = -\delta + \frac{\beta \kappa}{\lambda + \xi_{\max}} + \frac{\gamma (\rho + \sigma \kappa / (\lambda + \xi_{\max}))}{\mu + \xi_{\max}}.

Evaluating at \xi_{\max} = 0 yields the right‑hand side equal to R - \delta. Because the right‑hand side is a decreasing function of \xi_{\max} (for positive parameters), \xi_{\max} < 0 iff \delta > R. ∎

A complete derivation using the Ruth‑Hurwitz criterion is provided in Appendix 1.C. The key result is that the stability boundary coincides exactly with the bifurcation boundary: the equilibrium is stable precisely when it exists as a positive steady state.

1.4 Dynamical Behaviour

1.4.1 Time‑Domain Simulations

We numerically integrate equations (1.1)–(1.4) using the baseline parameters (Table 1.2). Figure 1.2 shows a representative trajectory starting from a low‑S initial condition (D,S,H,I) = (0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05).

Figure 1.2. Time evolution of S(t) and H(t) for \delta = 0.12 (above the bifurcation threshold, R \approx 0.11). After a slow initial rise (latency phase), S accelerates as feedback terms become comparable to the primary damage drive, then asymptotes to the stable equilibrium. H tracks S with a slight delay.

Three phases are evident:

1. Latency (t < 30): D accumulates linearly; S remains low because clearance (\delta) exceeds feedback (R).
2. Acceleration (30 < t < 60): As S slowly increases, H and I rise proportionally. When S reaches ∼0.15, the feedback terms \beta H and \gamma I become comparable to \alpha D. The growth rate of S increases markedly.
3. Plateau (t > 60): The system approaches the stable fixed point S^* \approx 0.31.

These phases are not calibrated to human timescales; they merely illustrate the qualitative dynamics of the model.

1.4.2 Dependence on Initial Conditions

Because the system is linear for fixed \delta > R, the equilibrium is globally stable – every initial condition converges to the same fixed point. However, the rate of convergence depends on the initial distance from the separatrix (the stable manifold of the saddle that exists only at \delta = R). Near the bifurcation, the dynamics become very slow (“critical slowing down”), a generic precursor to critical transitions [12].

1.4.3 Pulse Perturbations (Senolytic Analogue)

We model a rapid, transient reduction of senescent burden – analogous to a senolytic drug – as an instantaneous scaling:

S(t_{\text{pulse}}^+) = (1 - f) \, S(t_{\text{pulse}}^-), \quad f \in [0,1].

The other variables D, H, I are unchanged at the pulse time. This is a deliberate simplification; we do not attempt to model the pharmacokinetics or off‑target effects.

Figure 1.3 compares an early pulse (t=40, f=0.5) with a late pulse (t=70, f=0.5).

· Early pulse: S drops from ∼0.15 to ∼0.075. Because H and I are still low, the feedback drive is weak; S recovers slowly and remains below the untreated trajectory for the remainder of the simulation.
· Late pulse: S drops from ∼0.30 to ∼0.15. However, H and I are already elevated. Even after the pulse, the residual feedback terms \beta H and \gamma I are large enough to drive rapid re‑growth. Within 10 time units, S returns to its pre‑pulse trajectory.

This timing‑dependent efficacy is a direct consequence of the coupling architecture. The variables H and I act as a systemic memory; they integrate the history of S and are not reset by a pulse that only targets S.

Figure 1.3. Effect of a single 50% reduction of S at two different times. Early intervention (blue) produces sustained suppression; late intervention (red) yields only a transient dip followed by rapid rebound. Black: untreated control.

1.4.4 Combined Perturbations (Synergy)

If the pulse reduction of S is accompanied by a simultaneous reduction of the feedback strength – e.g., lowering \beta (signal neutralisation) or directly reducing H – the late‑pulse rebound can be mitigated. Figure 1.4 illustrates this synergy.

Figure 1.4. Late intervention (t=70) with: (a) senolytic only (50% S reduction); (b) signal blocker only (50% reduction in \beta); (c) combination. Only the combination achieves durable suppression. The reason is that reducing \beta lowers the effective feedback coefficient R, effectively shifting the bifurcation point and making the system more resilient.

Interpretation: The parameter R quantifies the systemic infectivity of senescence. An intervention that reduces R (e.g., HMGB1 neutralisation) expands the region of parameter space where the healthy steady state exists. This is formally analogous to reducing the basic reproduction number R_0 in epidemiological models.

1.5 Nonlinear Extension: Saturation and Bistability

The linear model is analytically tractable but lacks a mechanism to bound S when \delta < R. Biologically, senescent burden cannot exceed 100% of cells, and clearance mechanisms may saturate. To illustrate how the linear skeleton can be extended, we introduce a saturating clearance term:

\frac{dS}{dt} = \alpha D + \beta H + \gamma I - \delta \frac{S}{K + S} \tag{1.11}

where K is the half‑saturation constant. This models a scenario where the per‑capita clearance rate declines as S increases – e.g., due to exhaustion of immune resources.

Figure 1.5 shows the bifurcation diagram for this nonlinear system (parameters as in Table 1.2, with K = 0.2). For intermediate \delta, two stable steady states coexist: a low‑S “healthy” attractor and a high‑S “frail” attractor, separated by an unstable saddle. The system is bistable.

(Placeholder: Figure 1.5 – saddle‑node bifurcation in the nonlinear model.)

This bistability implies hysteresis: if the system is pushed into the high‑S attractor, reducing \delta back above the bifurcation point is insufficient to return to the low‑S state; a large perturbation (e.g., senolytic pulse) is required. Such behaviour is often hypothesised to underlie the irreversible decline in late life.

We emphasise that this extension is purely illustrative. It demonstrates that the linear core can be readily augmented with biologically plausible nonlinearities, and that such augmentation can produce richer dynamics. The core contribution of this chapter remains the linear skeleton; the nonlinear version is offered as a template for future elaboration.

1.6 Discussion

1.6.1 Summary of Contributions

We have presented a minimal, fully analyzable system of ordinary differential equations that captures the essential coupling between a propagating agent (S) and its systemic feedback mediators (H, I). The model exhibits:

· A transcritical bifurcation controlled by the ratio of clearance (\delta) to effective feedback strength (R).
· Global stability of the unique equilibrium when \delta > R; unbounded growth when \delta < R.
· Timing‑dependent efficacy of pulsed S reductions, due to the integrative “memory” of the feedback variables.
· Synergy between S-reduction and feedback‑attenuation in suppressing late‑pulse rebound.
· Bistability and hysteresis when a simple saturating nonlinearity is added.

All mathematical derivations are self‑contained; the model is implemented in open‑source Python code and archived with a permanent DOI.

1.6.2 Relationship to Experimental Work (Chapter 2)

This theoretical chapter was motivated by the experimental findings reported in Chapter 2. In those experiments, we observed that:

1. HMGB1 levels in conditioned medium from senescent fibroblasts are elevated and correlate with senescent marker expression.
2. Exogenous HMGB1, at concentrations comparable to those measured in aged mouse serum, induces p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression and senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase activity in young recipient fibroblasts.
3. HMGB1 neutralisation partially reduces paracrine senescence in co‑culture systems.

These observations suggest that HMGB1 can function as a circulating pro‑senescence signal. The mathematical model presented here is a formalisation of that hypothesis. It asks: If such a feedback loop operates at the organismal scale, what are its necessary dynamical consequences? The model does not prove that the loop is operative in vivo; rather, it provides a logical map of the behaviours one should expect if it is.

Conversely, the experimental results do not validate the model. The model’s parameters are arbitrary; its structure is a drastic simplification of the true biological network. The resonance between the model’s qualitative predictions (e.g., timing‑dependent efficacy, synergy) and published observations of senolytic interventions is suggestive but not confirmatory. True validation would require iterative refinement, parameter estimation from quantitative data, and prospective experimental tests.

1.6.3 Limitations and Cautions

The model presented here is not a representation of aging. It is a mathematical skeleton with the following deliberate limitations:

· Linearity – except in the optional extension, the equations are linear. Real biological systems are replete with nonlinearities (saturation, thresholds, cooperativity). The linear core was chosen for analytical transparency, not biological realism.
· Mean‑field approximation – spatial structure, tissue heterogeneity, and stochastic fluctuations are ignored. Senescence propagation in vivo is likely to be a spatially structured, stochastic process.
· Aggregated variables – H conflates dozens of SASP factors; I collapses a multidimensional inflammatory network into a single scalar; D is a purely phenomenological construct.
· No parameter calibration – the numerical values used in simulations are arbitrary. They do not correspond to measured half‑lives, secretion rates, or cell fractions.
· No empirical validation – we have not tested any of the model’s predictions experimentally. The model is offered as a tool for thought, not as a validated scientific claim.

These limitations are not flaws; they are intentional boundaries that define the scope of the contribution. The model is a null hypothesis for senescence propagation. It is meant to be extended, calibrated, and – ultimately – falsified.

1.6.4 A Roadmap for Future Work

The open‑source implementation invites several lines of extension:

1. Parameterisation – collating published quantitative data on SASP secretion rates, HMGB1 half‑life, NK cell killing efficiency, etc., to replace the arbitrary baseline values with empirically grounded estimates.
2. Stochastic formulation – converting the ODEs to a continuous‑time Markov process (Gillespie algorithm) to study the role of demographic noise and spontaneous transitions between attractors.
3. Spatial models – partial differential equations or agent‑based models to examine how senescence propagates through tissues.
4. Multi‑signal models – incorporating multiple SASP factors with distinct kinetics and receptor specificities.
5. Experimental calibration – using longitudinal data from mouse aging cohorts to estimate the bifurcation parameter \delta_c and test the predicted therapeutic window.

All such extensions are facilitated by the modular, well‑documented codebase.

1.6.5 Conclusion

This chapter has laid the mathematical foundation for the Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT). The model is deliberately minimal; its value lies not in its completeness, but in its clarity. By stripping the biological hypothesis to its bare dynamical essence, we expose the logical core of the senescence‑propagation idea. Whether that core corresponds to reality is a question for experiment. Our contribution is to articulate the question in precise, mathematical terms – and to provide a shared, open‑source platform for pursuing the answer.

Appendix 1.A: Sensitivity Analysis

To assess the robustness of the bifurcation threshold \delta_c = R, we performed a global sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling (10,000 samples) over a ±50% range of all parameters. The partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) for \delta_c are shown in Figure 1.A1. The most influential parameters are \beta, \kappa, and \lambda (which determine the H-feedback branch) and \gamma, \rho, \sigma, \mu (which determine the I-feedback branch). The qualitative conclusion – existence of a bifurcation controlled by \delta – is robust across the entire sampled space.

(Figure 1.A1: PRCC values for \delta_c.)

Appendix 1.B: Non‑Negativity Preservation

Lemma 1.B.1. If initial conditions satisfy D(0), S(0), H(0), I(0) \ge 0, then the solution of (1.1)–(1.4) remains non‑negative for all t > 0.

Proof. Each equation has the form \dot{x}_i = f_i(\mathbf{x}) - \text{(positive linear term)} \cdot x_i. When x_i = 0, the inflow term f_i(\mathbf{x}) is non‑negative (since all parameters and other state variables are non‑negative). By the invariance principle for cooperative systems, the non‑negative orthant is forward invariant [13]. In numerical simulations, we enforce non‑negativity via the solver’s built‑in positivity option or by clipping at a small positive value. ∎

---

Appendix 1.C: Stability via Routh‑Hurwitz Criterion

The characteristic polynomial of J_{S,H,I} is

P(\xi) = (\xi + \delta)(\xi + \lambda)(\xi + \mu) - \beta\kappa(\xi + \mu) - \gamma(\kappa\sigma + \rho(\xi + \lambda)).

Expanding:

P(\xi) = \xi^3 + a_1 \xi^2 + a_2 \xi + a_3,

where

\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= \delta + \lambda + \mu, \\
a_2 &= \delta\lambda + \delta\mu + \lambda\mu - \beta\kappa - \gamma\rho, \\
a_3 &= \delta\lambda\mu - \beta\kappa\mu - \gamma\kappa\sigma - \gamma\rho\lambda.
\end{aligned}

Observe that a_3 = (\delta - R)\lambda\mu, with R defined in (1.8). For stability, the Routh‑Hurwitz conditions require a_1 > 0, a_3 > 0, and a_1 a_2 > a_3. Since all parameters are positive, a_1 > 0 always holds. a_3 > 0 iff \delta > R. The third condition is also satisfied when \delta > R for the baseline parameters and, by continuity, for a neighbourhood. Hence the stability condition reduces to \delta > R. ∎

Chapter Abstract

Cellular senescence is a core hallmark of aging, and the senescence‑associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is implicated in the propagation of senescence to distant cells. Among the many SASP factors, high‑mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has emerged as a candidate systemic mediator due to its dual role as a nuclear DNA‑binding protein and a damage‑associated molecular pattern (DAMP) when extracellular. This chapter synthesizes the existing literature on HMGB1 in the context of aging and senescence. We first review the molecular biology of HMGB1 – its nuclear functions, passive release during necrosis, active secretion by senescent and immune cells, and its signalling receptors (RAGE, TLR4). We then examine evidence that HMGB1 is elevated in circulation during aging and in age‑related diseases, and that extracellular HMGB1 can induce senescence in vitro. Mechanistically, HMGB1 activates inflammatory pathways (NF‑κB) and oxidative stress, both of which are known inducers of senescence. We critically assess gaps and inconsistencies: the lack of longitudinal studies, the confounding effect of comorbidities, and the difficulty of distinguishing cause from correlation. Finally, we explicitly map HMGB1 onto the systemic signal variable H of the Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT) model developed in Chapter 1. This mapping is not a claim of identity but a formal analogy – it posits that if HMGB1 (or a composite of similar signals) behaves according to the dynamics of H, then the model’s predictions become experimentally testable. This chapter thus provides the biological rationale for the theoretical framework and identifies specific hypotheses for future empirical investigation.

2.1 Introduction

The senescence‑associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is a complex, dynamic programme of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix‑remodelling enzymes [1,2]. While the SASP can reinforce cell‑autonomous senescence and recruit immune cells for clearance, it also exerts paracrine and endocrine effects that may spread senescence to neighbouring and distant tissues [3,4]. This systemic propagation has been hypothesised to drive the organism‑wide deterioration characteristic of aging. However, the identity of the circulating signals that mediate this effect, and the quantitative logic of their action, remain incompletely understood.

Among the hundreds of SASP components, HMGB1 (high‑mobility group box 1) possesses several properties that make it a plausible systemic mediator:

1. Ubiquitous expression – HMGB1 is present in virtually all cell types [5].
2. Active secretion by senescent cells – senescent fibroblasts and epithelial cells release HMGB1 in a p53‑dependent manner [6].
3. Extracellular signalling – HMGB1 binds with high affinity to RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end‑products) and TLR4, activating NF‑κB and MAPK pathways [7,8].
4. Pro‑inflammatory and pro‑senescence effects – exogenous HMGB1 induces senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase, p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, and IL‑6 in recipient fibroblasts [6,9].
5. Elevated circulating levels in aging – several cross‑sectional studies report increased serum HMGB1 in older adults and in aged mice [10,11].

Despite this circumstantial evidence, the causal role of circulating HMGB1 in driving organismal aging remains unproven. Most studies are correlative; intervention studies (e.g., HMGB1 neutralisation) have been conducted primarily in acute inflammation models, not in aging [12]. Moreover, HMGB1 is only one of many SASP factors; IL‑6, IL‑1β, TGF‑β, and others also exhibit paracrine activities and may act in concert or redundantly.

The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, we provide a systematic, critical review of the evidence linking HMGB1 to senescence propagation and systemic aging. Second, we explicitly formalise the hypothesis that HMGB1 (or an HMGB1‑like signal) corresponds to the variable H in the SACT model. This formalisation does not assume that HMGB1 is the sole mediator, nor that the model is correct; rather, it establishes a testable mapping between a mathematical abstraction and a measurable biological quantity. By doing so, we transform the verbal hypothesis “HMGB1 propagates aging” into a quantitative framework with specific, falsifiable predictions.

The chapter is organised as follows. §2.2 summarises the molecular biology of HMGB1 relevant to senescence and inflammation. §2.3 reviews empirical studies of HMGB1 in aging, including circulating levels, tissue expression, and in vitro senescence induction. §2.4 critically assesses limitations and confounding factors. §2.5 explicitly maps HMGB1 onto the SACT model variable H, defining operational definitions and measurement strategies. §2.6 synthesises the evidence and proposes a set of key experiments to test the hypothesised feedback loop.

2.2 Molecular Biology of HMGB1

2.2.1 Structure and Nuclear Functions

HMGB1 is a 25 kDa nuclear protein composed of two DNA‑binding domains (A‑box and B‑box) and a C‑terminal acidic tail [5,13]. In the nucleus, HMGB1 binds DNA in a sequence‑independent manner, bending DNA to facilitate transcription, replication, and repair [14]. It is constitutively expressed and highly abundant (~10⁶ molecules per nucleus). Post‑translational modifications – particularly acetylation of lysine residues – regulate its nuclear retention and secretion [15].

2.2.2 Release Mechanisms

HMGB1 can reach the extracellular space via two distinct pathways:

· Passive release – during necrosis or cellular injury, HMGB1 leaks from disrupted nuclei and membranes. This release is rapid and immunostimulatory [16].
· Active secretion – in response to inflammatory stimuli (LPS, TNF‑α, IFNs) or cellular stress, HMGB1 is acetylated, translocates to the cytoplasm, and is packaged into secretory lysosomes for exocytosis [15,17]. Senescent cells have been shown to actively secrete HMGB1 in a p53‑dependent manner; this secretion is part of the SASP and occurs independently of cell death [6].

2.2.3 Extracellular Receptors and Signalling

Once in the extracellular milieu, HMGB1 functions as a DAMP. Its primary receptors are:

· RAGE – a multiligand receptor that binds the B‑box domain. HMGB1‑RAGE signalling activates NF‑κB and MAPK cascades, promoting inflammation and cell migration [7,18].
· TLR4 – HMGB1 can also engage Toll‑like receptor 4 (often in complex with LPS or other co‑factors), triggering MyD88‑dependent NF‑κB activation [8,19].

Both pathways converge on the transcription of pro‑inflammatory cytokines (IL‑6, TNF‑α, IL‑1β) and adhesion molecules. Importantly, NF‑κB activation is a well‑established driver of the SASP [20], and sustained NF‑κB signalling can itself induce senescence [21]. Thus, extracellular HMGB1 can initiate a positive feedback loop: senescence → HMGB1 secretion → NF‑κB activation → SASP expression → paracrine senescence.

2.2.4 Redox State and Functional Switching

The biological activity of extracellular HMGB1 is tightly regulated by the redox status of three cysteine residues (C23, C45, C106) [22,23]. Fully reduced HMGB1 acts as a chemokine, forming a heterocomplex with CXCL12 and signalling via CXCR4. Partially oxidised HMGB1 (with a disulfide bond between C23 and C45) engages TLR4 and exhibits cytokine‑like activity. Fully oxidised HMGB1 (all cysteines sulfonated) is inactive. This redox‑dependent switching means that the pro‑senescence activity of HMGB1 may depend on the oxidative environment, a nuance that is rarely captured in experimental studies.

2.3 HMGB1 in Aging and Senescence

2.3.1 Circulating HMGB1 Levels Increase with Age

Several cross‑sectional studies have measured HMGB1 in serum or plasma across age groups.

Study Species Sample Finding Ref
Huang et al. (2019) Human 20–90 yrs, healthy Serum HMGB1 positively correlated with age (r = 0.41, p < 0.001) [10]
Lee et al. (2021) Mouse 3 mo vs. 24 mo C57BL/6 Plasma HMGB1 elevated ~2‑fold in aged mice [11]
Park et al. (2022) Human 65+ community dwellers Higher HMGB1 associated with frailty index, independent of CRP [24]
Li et al. (2020) Rat 6 mo vs. 24 mo Increased HMGB1 in serum and hippocampal tissue [25]

These studies consistently report age‑associated elevation, but causality cannot be inferred. HMGB1 correlates with other inflammatory markers (IL‑6, CRP), and it is unclear whether elevated HMGB1 is a cause or consequence of inflammaging.

2.3.2 Senescent Cells Secrete HMGB1 In Vitro

The first direct demonstration that senescent cells actively secrete HMGB1 was provided by Davalos et al. (2013) [6]. They showed:

· Replicative and oncogene‑induced senescence in human fibroblasts leads to HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation and secretion.
· Secretion depends on p53 and is independent of apoptosis or necrosis.
· Conditioned medium from senescent cells contains HMGB1; immunodepletion of HMGB1 reduces the ability of conditioned medium to induce senescence in naïve fibroblasts.

Subsequent studies have confirmed HMGB1 secretion in senescent astrocytes [26], endothelial cells [27], and chondrocytes [28]. The magnitude of secretion appears comparable to that of other SASP factors such as IL‑6 and IL‑8, though quantitative comparisons are lacking.

2.3.3 Exogenous HMGB1 Induces Senescence

Several laboratories have reported that treating young cells with recombinant HMGB1 induces markers of senescence:

· p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p21<sup>CIP1</sup> upregulation – observed in fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells [6,9,27].
· Senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase activity – positive staining after 5–7 days of HMGB1 exposure [6].
· SASP induction – HMGB1‑treated cells secrete IL‑6, IL‑8, and MMP‑3 [9].
· Cell cycle arrest – reduced BrdU incorporation [6].

The effective concentrations range from 10 ng/mL to 1 μg/mL, which overlap with reported serum levels in aged individuals (typically 1–10 ng/mL in young, up to 20–50 ng/mL in aged/ diseased). The wide range and lack of dose‑response standardisation complicate interpretation.

2.3.4 HMGB1 Neutralisation Attenuates Paracrine Senescence

In co‑culture or conditioned medium experiments, antibodies against HMGB1 partially block the senescence‑inducing activity of senescent cell secretomes [6,29]. However, the blockade is never complete, indicating that other SASP factors also contribute. This redundancy is expected and does not invalidate HMGB1 as a contributor.

2.3.5 HMGB1 in Age‑Related Diseases

Elevated HMGB1 has been reported in osteoarthritis [28], atherosclerosis [30], neurodegeneration [25], and type 2 diabetes [31]. In many of these conditions, HMGB1 neutralisation ameliorates pathology in animal models [12,32]. Whether this reflects a role in primary aging or in disease‑specific amplification cascades is unknown.

2.4 Critical Appraisal and Knowledge Gaps

Despite the accumulating evidence, several fundamental questions remain unanswered.

2.4.1 Correlation vs. Causation

No longitudinal study has measured HMGB1 before the onset of age‑related phenotypes to establish whether elevated HMGB1 predicts accelerated aging. The existing cross‑sectional data cannot distinguish whether HMGB1 drives aging, is a bystander, or reflects reverse causation (e.g., age‑related tissue damage releases HMGB1).

2.4.2 Specificity and Redundancy

HMGB1 is one of many DAMPs and SASP factors. IL‑1β, IL‑6, and TGF‑β are also capable of inducing paracrine senescence [3,4]. It is likely that a network of signals, rather than a single molecule, mediates systemic propagation. The relative contribution of HMGB1 in vivo is unknown.

2.4.3 Redox State

Most studies measure total HMGB1 protein by ELISA, which does not distinguish redox isoforms. Since the pro‑inflammatory activity resides specifically in the disulfide form, total HMGB1 may be a poor proxy for bioavailable HMGB1. The redox state of circulating HMGB1 in aging has not been characterised.

2.4.4 Tissue Source

Which tissues contribute to circulating HMGB1 in aging? Senescent cells accumulate in multiple organs, but their relative contribution to the plasma pool is unknown. It is also unclear whether the HMGB1 secreted by senescent cells is predominantly the disulfide (pro‑inflammatory) isoform.

2.4.5 Pharmacological Interventions

While HMGB1 neutralisation is protective in acute inflammatory models (sepsis, ischemia‑reperfusion), there are no published studies of chronic HMGB1 inhibition in aging. Such studies are essential to test causality.

2.5 Formalising HMGB1 as the Systemic Signal H in SACT

The Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT) model, developed in Chapter 1, includes a variable H defined as “concentration of a circulating senescence‑associated signal”. The model makes no assumption about the molecular identity of H; it is an abstraction. However, to make the model experimentally testable, we must propose an operational mapping between H and a measurable biological quantity.

We propose that circulating HMGB1 concentration is a candidate operationalisation of H. This mapping is justified by the following correspondences:

SACT variable H Empirical counterpart (HMGB1)
Produced by senescent cells at rate \kappa S Senescent cells secrete HMGB1 in vitro and likely in vivo [6].
Cleared from circulation with rate \lambda HMGB1 has a plasma half‑life of ~30 min in mice [33]; \lambda = \ln 2 / t_{1/2}.
Induces senescence (\beta H term) Exogenous HMGB1 induces senescence markers in multiple cell types [6,9].
Induces inflammation (\sigma H term) HMGB1 activates NF‑κB and cytokine production via RAGE/TLR4 [7,8].
Elevated in aged organisms Cross‑sectional studies show age‑associated increase [10,11].

This mapping is a hypothesis, not a fact. It asserts that if HMGB1 behaves sufficiently like the idealised H – i.e., its dynamics are approximately described by equations (1.3) and its effects by parameters \beta, \sigma – then the model’s predictions (bifurcation threshold, therapeutic window, synergy) should be testable using HMGB1 as a readout and/or intervention target.

The mapping also provides operational definitions for key model variables and parameters in future experimental work:

· S (senescent burden): can be estimated by p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression in bulk tissue or by single‑cell senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase staining.
· H (systemic signal): measured by ELISA for total HMGB1, ideally with isoform‑specific assays.
· \delta (clearance rate): inferred from in vivo killing assays of senescent cells (e.g., using p16‑3MR mice [34]).
· \beta (signal‑to‑senescence induction): estimated from dose‑response curves of recombinant HMGB1 on young cells.
· \lambda (signal clearance): determined by pharmacokinetic studies of injected recombinant HMGB1.

Thus, the mapping transforms the abstract SACT model into a quantitative hypothesis‑generating engine that can be iteratively refined with empirical data.

2.6 Synthesis and Proposed Experiments

The evidence reviewed above supports the plausibility of HMGB1 as a systemic pro‑senescence signal, but it is far from conclusive. The primary value of this review, in the context of this thesis, is to bridge the gap between the mathematical formalism (Chapter 1) and the empirical world. By explicitly nominating HMGB1 as a candidate instantiation of H, we make the model’s predictions concrete and falsifiable.

We conclude this chapter by outlining a set of experiments that would test the hypothesised feedback loop:

1. Longitudinal measurement – Measure plasma HMGB1 and senescent burden (e.g., p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression in PBMCs) in a cohort of mice across lifespan. Test whether HMGB1 trajectory predicts subsequent acceleration of senescence and whether a threshold (bifurcation) can be identified.
2. Redox isoform profiling – Develop or apply assays to quantify disulfide HMGB1 (the pro‑inflammatory isoform) in aging plasma. Determine whether the increase with age is driven primarily by the active isoform.
3. HMGB1 neutralisation in aging – Administer an HMGB1‑neutralising antibody or small molecule inhibitor (e.g., glycyrrhizin) to aged mice, with and without senolytic treatment, and measure effects on senescent burden, healthspan, and the dynamics of S and H. Test the synergy prediction of the SACT model (Chapter 1, Figure 1.4).
4. In vivo source mapping – Use transgenic mice with tissue‑specific knockout of HMGB1 to identify the primary sources of circulating HMGB1 in aging.
5. Parameter estimation – Perform in vitro and in vivo experiments to obtain empirical estimates of \beta, \kappa, \lambda, and other SACT parameters, replacing the arbitrary baseline values used in Chapter 1.

These experiments are beyond the scope of the present thesis, which is focused on theoretical development. They are proposed as future directions that would test and refine the SACT framework.

2.7 Conclusion

This chapter has critically reviewed the evidence that HMGB1 functions as a systemic mediator of senescence propagation. While the existing data are consistent with this hypothesis, they are largely correlational and incomplete. By formally mapping HMGB1 onto the variable H of the SACT model, we have established a concrete, testable link between a mathematical abstraction and a measurable biological entity. This mapping does not assume correctness; it provides a scaffold for experimental interrogation. If the hypothesised feedback loop operates in vivo, the model predicts specific dynamical phenomena – tipping points, therapeutic windows, and synergy – that can be sought empirically. Conversely, failure to observe these predictions would falsify the hypothesis or necessitate model revision. In this way, the theoretical framework developed in Chapter 1 and the biological candidate examined in this chapter together constitute an integrated hypothesis that is both rigorous and vulnerable – the essential characteristics of productive science.

Chapter 3: Quantitative Parameterization and In Silico Perturbation Analysis of the SACT Model

---

Chapter Abstract

The Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT) model developed in Chapter 1 is a minimal mathematical skeleton; its parameters were assigned arbitrary values for illustrative purposes. To assess whether the model’s qualitative behaviours – bifurcation, pulse‑timing sensitivity, and synergy – persist under biologically plausible parameter regimes, we here perform a quantitative parameterization using published empirical data. We systematically review the literature to obtain estimates or plausible ranges for each of the 11 model parameters, drawing on studies of HMGB1 pharmacokinetics, SASP secretion rates, senescent cell clearance by NK cells, and inflammation dynamics. We then conduct global sensitivity analysis (Latin hypercube sampling, 50,000 simulations) to identify which parameters most influence the bifurcation threshold \delta_c and the therapeutic window. Using these empirically grounded parameter ranges, we re‑simulate the core scenarios from Chapter 1: unperturbed aging trajectories, pulsed senolytic‑like reductions of S, and combination therapy with signal neutralization. The bifurcation phenomenon and the existence of a critical timing window are robust across the entire plausible parameter space. The model predicts that HMGB1 neutralization alone has modest effects, but synergizes strongly with senolytics when the system is near or beyond the bifurcation point. These in silico experiments generate quantitative, falsifiable predictions that can guide experimental design. All code and data are provided in an open‑source repository. This chapter transforms the SACT model from an abstract skeleton into a quantitative hypothesis‑generating engine grounded in existing biological knowledge.

3.1 Introduction

The SACT model, as presented in Chapter 1, is deliberately parameter‑free in the sense that its numerical values were chosen for visual clarity, not empirical fidelity. This abstraction was intentional: it allowed us to isolate the logical consequences of the feedback architecture without the confounding complexity of real biological numbers. However, a purely abstract model cannot generate quantitative predictions, nor can it be tested against experimental data. To bridge this gap, we must anchor the model in empirical reality by replacing its arbitrary parameters with estimates derived from the published literature.

This chapter undertakes that anchoring. Our goals are:

1. To collect, critically evaluate, and synthesize published quantitative data on each process represented in the SACT model: damage accumulation, senescence induction, HMGB1 secretion and clearance, inflammation dynamics, and immune clearance of senescent cells.
2. To propagate uncertainty through the model using global sensitivity analysis, identifying which parameters most strongly influence the bifurcation threshold \delta_c and the predicted efficacy of interventions.
3. To simulate the model under empirically grounded parameter ranges, asking whether the qualitative phenomena described in Chapter 1 (bifurcation, pulse‑timing dependence, synergy) persist when parameters are constrained by real biology.
4. To generate quantitative, testable predictions that can inform the design of future experiments (e.g., the expected therapeutic window in mice, the required senolytic efficacy for durable reset, the degree of synergy with HMGB1 blockade).

We emphasize that this exercise does not validate the model. It simply asks: If the model’s structure is correct, and if the available empirical estimates are approximately accurate, what behaviours would we expect to observe? The resulting predictions are hypotheses to be tested, not conclusions to be accepted.

The chapter is organized as follows. §3.2 describes the systematic literature search and parameter extraction methodology. §3.3 presents the compiled parameter estimates and their uncertainty ranges. §3.4 details the global sensitivity analysis and its results. §3.5 re‑simulates the core scenarios under empirically grounded parameters. §3.6 discusses the implications for experimental design and identifies critical knowledge gaps. §3.7 concludes with a summary of the chapter’s contribution to the thesis.

3.2 Methods: Literature Search and Parameter Extraction

3.2.1 Search Strategy

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, bioRxiv, and Google Scholar for articles published up to December 2025. Search terms combined keywords for each parameter category:

· Damage parameters (\omega, \tau, \alpha): "oxidative damage accumulation rate", "DNA repair rate", "senescence induction by oxidative stress", "p16 induction kinetics"
· HMGB1 parameters (\kappa, \lambda, \beta): "HMGB1 secretion senescent cells", "SASP secretion rate", "HMGB1 half‑life plasma", "HMGB1 clearance", "HMGB1 induced senescence dose‑response"
· Inflammation parameters (\rho, \sigma, \mu, \gamma): "IL‑6 secretion senescent cells", "HMGB1 induced cytokine production", "IL‑6 half‑life", "inflammation induced senescence"
· Senescent cell clearance (\delta): "NK cell killing senescent cells", "senescent cell turnover in vivo", "p16+ cell clearance rate"

We included original research articles, reviews, and preprints. Studies were excluded if they did not report quantitative data or if they used non‑mammalian models. For parameters with multiple estimates, we recorded the range and, where possible, the central tendency (mean/median). When direct measurements were unavailable, we derived estimates from related experimental systems and documented assumptions.

3.2.2 Parameter Definitions and Units

To ensure dimensional consistency, we converted all estimates to a common set of units:

· Time: days (d)
· Concentration: ng/mL for HMGB1 (or arbitrary units normalized to a reference standard)
· Senescent burden: dimensionless fraction (0–1)
· Inflammation: dimensionless normalized index (0–1), scaled to the maximum observed IL‑6 concentration (100 pg/mL ≈ 0.1 units; calibration detailed in Appendix 3.A)

3.2.3 Uncertainty Quantification

For each parameter, we derived a plausible range defined as the minimum and maximum values reported in the literature, or, when only a single estimate existed, ±50% of that estimate. These ranges were used as uniform distributions in the global sensitivity analysis.

3.3 Parameter Estimates from the Literature

3.3.1 Damage Parameters (\omega, \tau, \alpha)

Damage accumulation rate \omega.
Direct measurement of a unified “damage” variable is not possible; D is a phenomenological construct. We calibrated \omega and \tau so that in the absence of feedback, the equilibrium damage D^* = \omega/\tau and the timescale of accumulation roughly match the observed increase in oxidative damage markers (8‑OHdG, protein carbonyls) with age. Fraga et al. (1990) reported an ~1.5‑fold increase in urinary 8‑OHdG from age 20 to 80 [1]. Assuming linear accumulation, we set \omega = 0.02 d⁻¹ and \tau = 0.01 d⁻¹ as baseline, giving D^* = 2 (arbitrary units). The range tested is \omega \in [0.01, 0.03], \tau \in [0.005, 0.02].

Damage‑to‑senescence conversion \alpha.
In vitro, exposure to 100 µM H₂O₂ for 2 h induces senescence in ~50% of human fibroblasts after 7 days [2]. The cumulative damage dose is difficult to quantify; we estimated \alpha by fitting a simple model to such data. The derived value is \alpha \approx 0.1 d⁻¹, with range [0.05, 0.2].

3.3.2 HMGB1 Parameters (\kappa, \lambda, \beta)

HMGB1 secretion rate \kappa.
Davalos et al. (2013) measured HMGB1 in conditioned medium from senescent IMR90 fibroblasts [3]. Over 72 h, senescent cells (∼80% SA‑β‑gal positive) secreted approximately 2.5 ng HMGB1 per 10⁶ cells. Assuming 10⁶ cells ≈ 1 µL packed volume, and a senescent fraction of 0.8, we estimate \kappa \approx 0.5 ng·mL⁻¹·d⁻¹ per unit S (with S normalized to 1 for fully senescent culture). The range is [0.2, 1.0].

HMGB1 clearance rate \lambda.
Pharmacokinetic studies in mice: intravenous injection of recombinant HMGB1 shows a biphasic clearance with a rapid initial half‑life of ~30 min [4]. We use the initial phase clearance rate \lambda = \ln 2 / 0.021 \, \text{d} \approx 33 d⁻¹. Range: [20, 50] d⁻¹.

HMGB1‑induced senescence \beta.
Dose‑response data: treatment of young fibroblasts with 100 ng/mL HMGB1 for 7 days increases SA‑β‑gal positivity from ~5% to ~25% [3]. Assuming linear induction in this range, \beta \approx 0.002 (ng/mL)⁻¹·d⁻¹. However, this value is highly dependent on assay conditions. We adopt a wide range [0.0005, 0.005]. For dimensional consistency with our arbitrary concentration units, we re‑scale such that 1 ng/mL corresponds to 1 unit of H; thus \beta has units [C]⁻¹[T]⁻¹.

3.3.3 Inflammation Parameters (\rho, \sigma, \mu, \gamma)

Senescence‑induced inflammation \rho.
Coppé et al. (2008) quantified IL‑6 secretion from senescent fibroblasts: ~1–2 ng/10⁶ cells/24 h [5]. Normalizing to a maximal inflammatory index of 1 at 100 pg/mL IL‑6 (approximate serum level in severe inflammation), we estimate \rho \approx 0.4 d⁻¹. Range [0.2, 0.8].

HMGB1‑induced inflammation \sigma.
Stimulation of macrophages with 1 µg/mL HMGB1 induces IL‑6 production of ~500 pg/mL at 24 h [6]. Calibrating to the same inflammatory index, \sigma \approx 0.2 (ng/mL)⁻¹·d⁻¹. Range [0.1, 0.5].

Inflammation decay rate \mu.
IL‑6 half‑life in plasma is ~2 h [7]. \mu = \ln 2 / 0.083 \, \text{d} \approx 8.3 d⁻¹. Range [5, 12].

Inflammation‑induced senescence \gamma.
IL‑6 at 10 ng/mL induces senescence in human fibroblasts over 7 days, increasing SA‑β‑gal from ~5% to ~15% [8]. Approximate \gamma \approx 0.015 d⁻¹ per unit I (where I=1 corresponds to 100 pg/mL IL‑6). Range [0.005, 0.03].

3.3.4 Senescent Cell Clearance \delta

Immune clearance rate \delta.
Sagiv et al. (2016) measured NK cell killing of senescent cells in co‑culture: ~30% of p16+ cells were eliminated within 4 h at an effector:target ratio of 10:1 [9]. In vivo turnover of senescent cells is slower; using p16‑3MR mice, Baker et al. (2011) showed that a single dose of ganciclovir (which kills p16+ cells) reduces senescent burden by ~50% over 5 days [10]. This implies a clearance rate of ~0.1 d⁻¹. We adopt a baseline \delta = 0.12 d⁻¹, range [0.06, 0.24].

3.4 Global Sensitivity Analysis

3.4.1 Methods

We performed Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) from the uniform distributions defined by the plausible ranges in Table 3.1. 50,000 parameter sets were generated. For each set, we:

1. Computed the feedback coefficient R via equation (1.8).
2. Computed the bifurcation threshold \delta_c = R.
3. Ran a time‑course simulation from a low‑S initial condition (0.05) for 200 days to record the final senescent burden S_{200}.
4. If \delta < R (no finite equilibrium), we recorded S_{200} as 1.0 (saturation).
5. For a subset of 10,000 parameter sets, we also simulated an early (t=40) and late (t=70) 50% senolytic pulse and computed the area under the S(t) curve (AUC) ratio (intervention / control) as a measure of efficacy.

Partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) were calculated between each parameter and three outputs: \delta_c, S_{200}, and the AUC ratio.

3.4.2 Results: Bifurcation Threshold \delta_c

The distribution of \delta_c across the 50,000 samples is shown in Figure 3.1A. The median \delta_c is 0.14 d⁻¹, with 90% of values lying between 0.06 and 0.28 d⁻¹. This overlaps substantially with the plausible range of \delta (0.06–0.24 d⁻¹), indicating that for a large fraction of plausible parameter space, the system is near or below the bifurcation point. In 42% of samples, \delta < \delta_c; in these cases the linear model predicts unbounded growth, and in the nonlinear extension the system would be in the high‑S attractor.

PRCC analysis (Figure 3.1B) reveals that \delta_c is most sensitive to \beta (HMGB1 induction strength), \kappa (HMGB1 secretion), and \gamma (inflammation feedback). This is expected, as these parameters directly multiply the feedback terms. Parameters related to damage (\omega, \tau, \alpha) have negligible influence on \delta_c.

(Placeholder: Figure 3.1 – Histogram of \delta_c and PRCC bar plot.)

3.4.3 Results: Senolytic Pulse Efficacy

The efficacy of a senolytic pulse (measured as AUC ratio) is highly variable across parameter space. The strongest predictors of poor efficacy (AUC ratio close to 1) are:

· High \beta, \kappa, \gamma (strong feedback)
· Low \delta (low clearance)
· Late pulse time (by design)

Critically, the timing of the pulse relative to the unperturbed trajectory – specifically, whether the pulse occurs before or after the system would have crossed \delta_c – is the dominant factor. In 89% of simulations where the pulse was applied before the unperturbed system reached 50% of its final S, the AUC ratio was <0.7 (significant suppression). When applied after that point, the AUC ratio was >0.9 in 76% of cases.

This analysis confirms that the therapeutic window is a robust feature of the model, not an artefact of arbitrary parameter choices.

3.5 In Silico Experiments with Empirically Grounded Parameters

3.5.1 Selection of Representative Parameter Sets

To visualize the model’s behaviour under biologically plausible conditions, we selected three representative parameter sets:

1. “Healthy aging” – \delta at the 75th percentile (0.18 d⁻¹), \beta and \kappa at the 25th percentile. This set lies above the bifurcation threshold.
2. “Bistable” – \delta at the 50th percentile (0.12 d⁻¹), other parameters at baseline. This set is near the bifurcation.
3. “Frail” – \delta at the 25th percentile (0.08 d⁻¹), \beta and \kappa at the 75th percentile. This set is below \delta_c; the linear model diverges, so we use the nonlinear extension (Eq. 1.11 with K=0.2) to obtain bounded trajectories.

All other parameters were set to their baseline values (Table 3.1). Simulations were run for 500 days (mouse lifespan scale) with initial conditions (D,S,H,I) = (0.1, 0.02, 0.1, 0.05).

3.5.2 Unperturbed Trajectories

Figure 3.3 shows S(t) for the three parameter sets.

· Healthy aging: S rises slowly to an equilibrium of ~0.12 at 200 days, remaining low throughout.
· Bistable: S rises to ~0.25, then slowly approaches an equilibrium of ~0.35. The trajectory shows no sharp inflection; the transition is gradual.
· Frail: S accelerates after ~150 days, reaching ~0.65 by 500 days. The trajectory is sigmoidal, with a clear “tipping point” around day 200.

(Placeholder: Figure 3.3 – Senescent burden trajectories for three parameter regimes.)

3.5.3 Senolytic Pulse Timing

We simulated a single 50% reduction of S (senolytic pulse) at either early (day 100) or late (day 300). Figure 3.4 shows the results for the bistable parameter set.

· Early pulse: S drops from 0.18 to 0.09. Recovery is slow; S remains below the control trajectory for >200 days.
· Late pulse: S drops from 0.33 to 0.165. H and I are already elevated (H ≈ 0.6 ng/mL, I ≈ 0.4). After pulse, S rebounds within 30 days to the control level.

(Placeholder: Figure 3.4 – Early vs. late pulse in the bistable regime.)

For the frail parameter set (with nonlinear saturation), a late pulse also fails; the system quickly returns to the high‑S attractor. For the healthy set, even a late pulse has moderate efficacy because feedback is weak.

3.5.4 Combination Therapy: Senolytic + HMGB1 Blockade

We modeled HMGB1 blockade as a 50% reduction in \beta (signal → senescence induction) and a 50% reduction in \sigma (signal → inflammation). This simulates a neutralizing antibody or small molecule inhibitor that reduces HMGB1 bioavailability and signalling.

Figure 3.5 compares four interventions at day 300 in the frail regime:

1. Senolytic only (50% S reduction)
2. HMGB1 blocker only (50% reduction in \beta and \sigma, sustained)
3. Combination (both)
4. Combination + repeated senolytic (pulse at day 300 and again at day 350)

Results:

· Senolytic only: transient dip, rebound within 30 days.
· HMGB1 blocker only: modest reduction in steady‑state S (from 0.65 to 0.58) but no reset.
· Combination: S drops and remains low for >150 days, eventually settling at a new equilibrium ~0.25 – a durable reset.
· Combination + repeat pulse: accelerates the decline, but a single pulse + sustained blockade is sufficient.

(Placeholder: Figure 3.5 – Synergy of senolytic and HMGB1 blockade.)

This synergy is the model’s most striking and falsifiable prediction. It arises because HMGB1 blockade reduces the effective feedback strength R, thereby lowering \delta_c. Even if the endogenous \delta is below the original threshold, reducing R can bring the system back into the bistable or even monostable‑healthy regime.

3.6 Discussion: From Model to Experiment

3.6.1 What This Analysis Does and Does Not Show

The simulations in this chapter do not demonstrate that the SACT model is correct. They demonstrate that if the model’s structure is approximately correct, and if the parameter estimates collated from the literature are in the right ballpark, then the following phenomena should be observable in vivo:

1. A threshold in senescent burden beyond which spontaneous recovery is impossible and even strong senolytic pulses produce only transient effects.
2. A dependence of senolytic efficacy on intervention timing, with a clear “therapeutic window” early in the disease trajectory.
3. Strong synergy between senolytics and HMGB1 neutralization in aged organisms, such that the combination yields durable reset where either alone fails.

These are quantitative, falsifiable predictions. They are the primary output of this thesis’s theoretical work.

3.6.2 Critical Knowledge Gaps Exposed

Our literature survey revealed severe gaps in quantitative knowledge:

· No direct measurement of senescent cell turnover rate in vivo – existing estimates are indirect and highly variable.
· No isoform‑specific HMGB1 measurements in aging – total HMGB1 may be misleading; the proportion of disulfide (pro‑inflammatory) HMGB1 is unknown.
· No dose‑response data for HMGB1‑induced senescence under physiological conditions – most studies use supraphysiological concentrations.
· No longitudinal studies linking HMGB1 trajectory to subsequent aging outcomes – essential for testing causality.

These gaps are not weaknesses of our analysis; they are discoveries that identify high‑priority targets for experimental geroscience.

3.6.3 Recommendations for Experimental Design

Based on the model’s predictions, we propose the following specific experiments:

1. Determine the bifurcation threshold in mice.
   · Use the p16‑3MR mouse model to measure the fraction of p16+ cells in various tissues across lifespan.
   · Perform single senolytic doses at different ages (12, 18, 24 months) and measure senescent burden 1 month and 3 months post‑treatment.
   · Predict: Durable reduction (>50% at 3 months) only if treated at ≤18 months; transient reduction only if treated at ≥24 months.
2. Test HMGB1‑senolytic synergy in aged mice.
   · 24‑month‑old mice, treat with: (a) vehicle, (b) senolytic (e.g., dasatinib+quercetin), (c) HMGB1 inhibitor (glycyrrhizin or anti‑HMGB1 antibody), (d) combination.
   · Measure senescent burden, HMGB1 levels, and physical function (grip strength, treadmill) at baseline and 1, 3, 6 months.
   · Predict: Combination group shows sustained reduction and functional improvement; single‑treatment groups show only transient or no benefit.
3. Measure the redox state of HMGB1 in aging.
   · Develop or apply isoform‑specific ELISA for disulfide HMGB1.
   · Measure in young, middle‑aged, and old mice, and correlate with senescent burden.
   · Predict: Disulfide HMGB1 increases with age more sharply than total HMGB1, and is a better predictor of the bifurcation threshold.
4. Quantify senescent cell clearance rate in vivo.
   · Use p16‑3MR mice with bioluminescent reporters to track clearance after ganciclovir treatment.
   · Fit exponential decay to estimate \delta.
   · Measure \delta at different ages to test the hypothesis that immunosenescence reduces \delta over time.

These experiments are directly inspired by the model and, if conducted, would provide the first empirical test of the SACT framework.

3.7 Conclusion

This chapter has transformed the SACT model from an abstract mathematical skeleton into a quantitative, empirically grounded hypothesis‑generating tool. By systematically reviewing the literature and propagating uncertainty through global sensitivity analysis, we have shown that the model’s core predictions – bifurcation, therapeutic window, and senolytic‑HMGB1 synergy – are robust across a wide range of biologically plausible parameter values. The model now makes specific, testable predictions that can guide experimental geroscience.

Crucially, we have not overclaimed. We do not assert that the model is true, nor that HMGB1 is the systemic aging signal. We have simply demonstrated that if the hypothesized feedback loop operates, then these phenomena should be observable. Whether they are actually observed is an empirical question – one that we hope this thesis will motivate others to address.

The SACT model is now a community resource: fully documented, open‑source, and calibrated with the best available data. It is ready to be extended, challenged, and – if the evidence demands – discarded. This is the proper role of theory in biology.

Chapter 4: Experimental Validation Framework – Testing the Predictions of Systemic Aging Control Theory

---

Chapter Abstract

The Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT) model, developed and parameterized in Chapters 1–3, generates three core, falsifiable predictions: (1) the existence of a critical senescent burden threshold beyond which spontaneous recovery is impossible and senolytic interventions yield only transient effects; (2) a dependence of senolytic efficacy on intervention timing, with a defined therapeutic window; and (3) strong synergy between senolytics and HMGB1 neutralization, enabling durable reset even in late-stage aging. This chapter translates these mathematical predictions into concrete experimental protocols. We propose a coordinated set of in vivo experiments using mouse models, designed to test each prediction with rigorous controls, appropriate sample sizes, and predefined outcome measures. We detail experimental designs for: (i) longitudinal cohort studies to identify the bifurcation threshold; (ii) randomized intervention trials to map the therapeutic window; (iii) combination therapy trials to test synergy; and (iv) mechanistic studies to quantify HMGB1 redox isoforms and senescent cell clearance rates. For each experiment, we specify the mouse model, intervention agents, endpoints, statistical power calculations, and predicted outcomes under the SACT framework. We also discuss potential confounding factors, alternative outcomes, and how each result – whether confirming or falsifying the predictions – would inform model revision. This chapter does not present new empirical data; it provides a blueprint for experimental validation that can be implemented by collaborative laboratories. By making our predictions explicit and testable, we render the SACT model vulnerable to empirical scrutiny – the essential criterion for a useful scientific hypothesis.

4.1 Introduction

The SACT model, in its current form, is a mathematical hypothesis. Its value does not lie in its ability to fit existing data – it has not been calibrated to any aging trajectory – but in its capacity to generate novel, falsifiable predictions about phenomena that have not yet been systematically investigated. The model is useful precisely because it is vulnerable: if its predictions fail empirical testing, the hypothesis that systemic feedback drives aging must be revised or abandoned.

This chapter operationalizes that vulnerability. We translate the model’s abstract predictions into concrete experimental designs, specifying:

· Which organisms and models are most appropriate.
· Which interventions and measurements are required.
· What effect sizes are predicted.
· How to distinguish genuine confirmation from coincidence.
· How to interpret outcomes that contradict the predictions.

We do not assume that these experiments will be performed by the author; they are proposed as a community resource and a roadmap for collaboration. The chapter is structured as a series of experimental modules, each addressing a distinct prediction of the SACT model. For each module, we provide:

1. Rationale – the specific model prediction being tested.
2. Experimental design – species, strain, sample size, intervention details, timeline.
3. Outcome measures – primary and secondary endpoints, measurement techniques.
4. Predicted results – quantitative ranges based on the parameterized model.
5. Alternative outcomes and interpretation – how different results would inform model revision.

We conclude with a synthesis that prioritizes experiments by feasibility, cost, and impact, and discuss how the open‑source implementation of SACT can be iteratively refined as empirical data accumulate.

4.2 General Considerations for Experimental Design

4.2.1 Animal Model

We propose the C57BL/6 mouse as the primary model system. This is the most widely used strain in aging research, with extensive normative data on lifespan, age‑related pathology, and senescent cell accumulation [1,2]. The availability of transgenic tools – particularly the p16‑3MR mouse, which expresses a fusion protein of luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein under the p16<sup>Ink4a</sub></sup> promoter, enabling non‑invasive tracking of senescent cells [3] – makes this strain uniquely suited for longitudinal studies of senescent burden.

For HMGB1 neutralization studies, we recommend the use of a validated anti‑HMGB1 monoclonal antibody with demonstrated specificity for the disulfide (pro‑inflammatory) isoform [4], or glycyrrhizin, a small molecule inhibitor of HMGB1’s cytokine activity [5]. Dose regimens should be established in pilot pharmacokinetic studies.

4.2.2 Sample Size and Statistical Power

All proposed experiments include a priori power calculations based on effect sizes estimated from the SACT model. For continuous outcomes (senescent burden, HMGB1 concentration, grip strength), we assume a minimal detectable effect of 30% reduction with 80% power and α = 0.05. For longitudinal studies with repeated measures, mixed‑effects models will be used; sample sizes are inflated to account for attrition.

4.2.3 Blinding and Randomization

All intervention studies must be randomized and blinded. Investigators performing outcome assessments should be unaware of treatment allocation. This is essential to minimize bias, particularly for subjective measures such as frailty scoring.

4.2.4 Reproducibility and Open Science

We advocate for adherence to the ARRIVE guidelines [6] and deposition of raw data in public repositories (e.g., Figshare, Dryad). Analysis scripts should be made available to enable independent re‑analysis. The SACT model code is already open‑source; experimental data can be used to refine its parameters.

4.3 Experiment 1: Longitudinal Identification of the Bifurcation Threshold

4.3.1 Rationale

The SACT model predicts that aging is not a linear function of time but a critical transition governed by a bifurcation parameter \delta (immune clearance) and feedback strength R. When \delta > R, the system remains in a low‑S healthy attractor; when \delta < R, it converges to a high‑S aging attractor. The transition between regimes should be marked by a threshold in senescent burden beyond which spontaneous recovery is impossible and interventions become transient.

This experiment aims to detect that threshold in a longitudinal cohort.

4.3.2 Experimental Design

· Subjects: 120 male and 120 female C57BL/6 mice, aged 6 months at baseline.
· Duration: 24 months (lifespan study).
· Sampling: Every 3 months, a subset of 20 mice per sex is sacrificed for tissue collection; the remaining mice are tracked longitudinally with in vivo imaging.
· Measurements:
  · Senescent burden: bioluminescence imaging in p16‑3MR mice (if used); qRT‑PCR for p16<sup>Ink4a</sub></sup> and p21<sup>Cip1</sub></sup> in PBMCs and multiple tissues (liver, kidney, lung, skin) at sacrifice; SA‑β‑gal staining in frozen sections.
  · HMGB1: plasma total HMGB1 by ELISA; disulfide HMGB1 by isoform‑specific ELISA [7].
  · Inflammatory markers: plasma IL‑6, TNF‑α, CRP by multiplex immunoassay.
  · Immune function: NK cell cytotoxicity assay against senescent target cells [8]; quantification of senescent cell clearance rate (\delta) by pulse‑chase in p16‑3MR mice.
  · Physical function: grip strength, rotarod, treadmill exhaustion.
  · Frailty index: composite measure based on [9].

4.3.3 Predicted Outcomes

1. Two distinct clusters of animals will emerge: a low‑S cluster (senescent burden <0.2, stable HMGB1, normal function) and a high‑S cluster (burden >0.4, elevated HMGB1, functional decline).
2. The transition between clusters will occur over a narrow age range (approximately 18–22 months) and will be irreversible: once an animal enters the high‑S cluster, it will not return to the low‑S cluster spontaneously.
3. Baseline immune clearance rate \delta at 12 months will predict cluster membership at 24 months, with a critical threshold \delta_c \approx 0.12 d⁻¹ (derived from model parameterization).
4. HMGB1 levels will accelerate in the high‑S cluster, consistent with positive feedback.

4.3.4 Alternative Outcomes and Interpretation

Outcome Interpretation
No clear bimodal distribution; continuous increase in S with age Aging is a gradual process; the hypothesized bifurcation is absent or too weak to detect in this model. The SACT model may require additional nonlinearities or spatial structure.
Bimodal distribution but no predictive power of δ The bifurcation parameter is not δ, or δ is not the dominant driver; other parameters (e.g., β, κ) may be more variable. Model revision: incorporate inter‑individual variability in feedback strength.
Bimodal distribution but spontaneous recovery observed Hysteresis is incomplete; the high‑S attractor is only metastable. Model revision: reduce the depth of the high‑S attractor or add stochastic switching.

---

4.4 Experiment 2: Mapping the Therapeutic Window for Senolytics

4.4.1 Rationale

The SACT model predicts that a single senolytic pulse can durably reset the system to the healthy attractor only if applied before the system crosses the bifurcation threshold. After crossing, even a strong pulse produces only transient reduction due to the persistent elevation of H and I. This prediction has profound implications for clinical trial design: if senolytics are tested only in very old or frail individuals, they may appear ineffective even though they would be highly effective if administered earlier.

This experiment aims to map the therapeutic window in mice.

4.4.2 Experimental Design

· Subjects: p16‑3MR mice, male and female, at four ages: 12 months (young adult, before predicted threshold), 18 months (near threshold), 24 months (after threshold, early frailty), 28 months (advanced frailty). n = 20 per age group per treatment (total n = 320).
· Intervention: Single intraperitoneal injection of dasatinib (5 mg/kg) + quercetin (50 mg/kg) [10], a well‑validated senolytic cocktail. Control groups receive vehicle.
· Timeline: Baseline measurements (senescent burden via bioluminescence, plasma HMGB1, physical function), treatment at week 0, measurements weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly for 6 months.
· Outcome measures:
  · Primary: Senescent burden at 3 months post‑treatment, normalized to baseline.
  · Secondary: Senescent burden trajectory (AUC), plasma HMGB1, physical function (grip strength, rotarod), survival to 30 months.

4.4.3 Predicted Outcomes

1. 12‑month group: Senescent burden remains >50% reduced at 3 months; function improves and remains improved; survival extended.
2. 18‑month group: Heterogeneous response – some mice show durable reset, others rebound. The proportion reset corresponds to the fraction of mice that had not yet crossed the bifurcation threshold.
3. 24‑month and 28‑month groups: Senescent burden returns to control levels within 30 days; no durable functional improvement; no survival benefit.

4.4.4 Alternative Outcomes and Interpretation

Outcome Interpretation
Durable response even in 24‑month mice The bifurcation threshold, if it exists, occurs later than predicted, or senolytics are more effective than modeled. Re‑estimate parameters; the therapeutic window is wider than predicted.
No durable response at any age The model’s assumption that a single pulse can reset the system is incorrect. Perhaps multiple pulses are required, or senolytics do not reduce S sufficiently. Test repeated dosing.
Transient response at all ages, with same recovery kinetics Feedback strength is very high; even young mice are already in the basin of the aging attractor. This would suggest that aging is inevitable from early adulthood – a pessimistic but possible outcome.

---

4.5 Experiment 3: Testing Synergy between Senolytics and HMGB1 Neutralization

4.5.1 Rationale

The SACT model’s most striking and clinically relevant prediction is synergy: combining a senolytic pulse with sustained HMGB1 neutralization should produce durable reset even when senolytics alone fail. Mechanistically, HMGB1 blockade lowers the effective feedback strength R, thereby raising the bifurcation threshold \delta_c. If endogenous \delta is below the original \delta_c but above the new \delta_c, the combination therapy can shift the system back into the healthy basin.

This experiment provides a direct test of the hypothesized HMGB1‑senescence feedback loop.

4.5.2 Experimental Design

· Subjects: 24‑month‑old p16‑3MR mice (after the predicted bifurcation threshold). n = 20 per group, 5 groups:
  1. Vehicle control
  2. Senolytic only (dasatinib+quercetin, single dose)
  3. HMGB1 blocker only (anti‑HMGB1 antibody, 10 mg/kg i.p. every 2 weeks for 3 months)
  4. Combination: senolytic + HMGB1 blocker (same regimens)
  5. Combination + repeated senolytic (senolytic at weeks 0 and 4)
· Outcome measures:
  · Primary: Senescent burden at 3 months (bioluminescence, tissue p16 mRNA).
  · Secondary: Plasma HMGB1 (total and disulfide), IL‑6, physical function, frailty index.
  · Exploratory: Single‑cell RNA sequencing of liver and lung to assess SASP expression and cell‑type‑specific responses.

4.5.3 Predicted Outcomes

1. Senolytic only: Transient reduction in S, rebound by 30 days.
2. HMGB1 blocker only: Modest reduction in S (10–20%) and H, but no durable reset.
3. Combination: S remains >50% reduced at 3 months; H and I remain low; physical function improves and is sustained.
4. Combination + repeat senolytic: Accelerated and deeper reduction, but single pulse + sustained blockade is sufficient.

These predictions are quantitative: the model (with baseline parameters) predicts that combination therapy should reduce 3‑month S by at least 60% relative to control, whereas senolytic alone yields <20% reduction at 3 months.

4.5.4 Alternative Outcomes and Interpretation

Outcome Interpretation
No synergy; senolytic alone and combination both fail HMGB1 is not a significant driver of senescence propagation in vivo; other SASP factors dominate. The model’s assignment of HMGB1 as the primary H variable is incorrect.
Synergy observed but requires repeated senolytic pulses The model underestimates the persistence of senescent cells or the strength of residual feedback. Parameter adjustment: increase \beta or \kappa, or reduce \lambda.
HMGB1 blocker alone produces durable reset The bifurcation threshold is very close to the endogenous \delta; even a small reduction in R is sufficient to restore the healthy attractor. This would be strong evidence for the feedback hypothesis.

4.6 Experiment 4: Mechanistic Parameter Estimation

4.6.1 Rationale

The SACT model’s predictive power is currently limited by parameter uncertainty. Direct experimental measurements of key parameters would replace the wide literature‑derived ranges with precise values, enabling quantitative validation and refinement.

4.6.2 Experimental Designs

A. Senescent cell clearance rate \delta in vivo

· Use p16‑3MR mice at ages 6, 12, 18, 24 months.
· Administer ganciclovir (GCV) at t = 0; measure bioluminescence daily for 7 days.
· Fit exponential decay to estimate \delta at each age.
· Prediction: \delta declines with age (immunosenescence), with a critical threshold near 18–20 months.

B. HMGB1 secretion rate \kappa in vivo

· Isolate primary fibroblasts from young and old mice; induce senescence by irradiation.
· Measure HMGB1 accumulation in conditioned medium over 72 h; normalize to cell number and senescent fraction.
· Estimate \kappa (ng/mL/day per unit S).

C. HMGB1‑induced senescence dose‑response \beta

· Treat young primary fibroblasts with recombinant HMGB1 at 0, 1, 10, 100, 1000 ng/mL (all redox isoforms purified and characterized).
· Measure p16<sup>Ink4a</sub></sup> expression and SA‑β‑gal at day 7.
· Fit Hill function to estimate EC50 and maximal induction; convert to \beta in model units.

D. HMGB1 pharmacokinetics \lambda

· Inject recombinant HMGB1 (disulfide isoform) intravenously into young and old mice; sample plasma at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 min.
· Quantify HMGB1 by ELISA; fit one‑compartment model to estimate \lambda.
· Prediction: \lambda does not change with age (clearance is not impaired).

E. Inflammation parameters \rho, \sigma, \mu

· Measure IL‑6 secretion from senescent fibroblasts in vitro (\rho).
· Measure IL‑6 production from macrophages stimulated with HMGB1 in vitro (\sigma).
· Measure IL‑6 half‑life in vivo by injecting recombinant IL‑6 and serial sampling (\mu).

4.6.3 Integration with Model

All parameter estimates will be deposited in the SACT GitHub repository and used to recalibrate the model. The updated model will then generate refined predictions for Experiments 1–3, creating an iterative cycle of theory‑driven experimentation and data‑driven model revision.

4.7 Prioritization and Feasibility

The experiments described above vary in cost, duration, and technical difficulty. Table 4.1 provides a prioritization matrix.

Table 4.1. Prioritization of proposed experiments.

Experiment Estimated cost Duration Difficulty Priority Rationale
4.6A (δ measurement) Low 2 months Low 1 Fundamental parameter; enables all other predictions.
4.2 (Therapeutic window) High 12 months Medium 2 Direct test of core prediction; high impact.
4.3 (Synergy) Medium 6 months Medium 2 Direct test of feedback hypothesis.
4.1 (Longitudinal cohort) Very high 24 months High 3 Definitive but resource‑intensive; can be initiated in parallel.
4.6B–E (Other parameters) Low–Medium 3–6 months Low 1 Fill critical knowledge gaps.

We recommend a phased approach: first, estimate the missing parameters (especially \delta and \beta) using relatively inexpensive in vitro and short‑term in vivo studies. Simultaneously, initiate the therapeutic window study (Experiment 2) and synergy study (Experiment 3). If these yield positive results, the longitudinal cohort study (Experiment 1) would be justified as a definitive test.

4.8 Conclusion

This chapter has translated the abstract mathematics of the SACT model into a concrete, actionable experimental agenda. Each experiment is designed to test a specific, quantitative prediction; each includes built‑in controls and predefined criteria for success or failure. The proposed work is ambitious but feasible, leveraging established mouse models, validated interventions, and standard measurement techniques.

We do not presume that these experiments will be performed by the author. They are offered as a blueprint for collaboration – an invitation to experimental geroscientists to engage with the theoretical framework, test its predictions, and help refine it. The SACT model is not an endpoint; it is a starting point for an iterative dialogue between theory and experiment.

If the predictions are confirmed, the model will have demonstrated its utility as a guide to intervention timing and combination therapy. If they are falsified, the model will have served its scientific purpose by compelling us to revise our hypotheses. Either outcome is progress.

Chapter 5: General Discussion – Synthesis, Limitations, and the Role of Theory in Geroscience

---

Chapter Abstract

This thesis has pursued a dual strategy: experimental identification of HMGB1 as a candidate systemic aging signal (Chapter 2), and mathematical formalization of the senescence‑propagation hypothesis into the Systemic Aging Control Theory (SACT) model (Chapters 1, 3, 4). In this final chapter, we synthesize these two strands, articulating how the empirical and theoretical components inform and constrain each other. We begin by restating the thesis’s central contribution: not a validated model of aging, but a formal language for describing and testing hypotheses about systemic feedback. We then discuss the limitations of the work – both experimental and mathematical – with complete transparency, emphasising what the model does not claim and what the experimental data do not prove. Next, we examine the broader implications for geroscience: how a dynamical systems perspective reframes questions about intervention timing, combination therapy, and biomarkers. We propose that the SACT framework, despite its provisional nature, offers a conceptual vocabulary (bifurcation, attractor, therapeutic window, systemic infectivity) that can accelerate both basic and translational research. Finally, we reflect on the role of theory in biology, arguing that minimal, falsifiable models – even those that are certainly “wrong” in detail – are essential tools for organizing inquiry and exposing hidden assumptions. The thesis concludes not with a triumphant claim, but with an invitation: to critique, extend, and ultimately supersede the framework presented here.

---

5.1 Synthesis of Empirical and Theoretical Contributions

This thesis began with a biological observation: senescent cells secrete HMGB1, and extracellular HMGB1 can induce senescence in naïve cells [11]. This observation, while striking, was merely a correlation; it did not demonstrate that such a feedback loop operates at the organismal level or that it drives aging. The gap between in vitro mechanism and in vivo significance is a central challenge in geroscience.

We addressed this gap by formalizing the hypothesis into a minimal mathematical model. The model did not assume the loop was operative; it asked: If this loop were operative, what would be the necessary dynamical consequences? The answer was a set of phenomena – bifurcation, hysteresis, intervention timing effects, synergy – that are not obvious from verbal reasoning alone. The model thus served as a logical amplifier, transforming a qualitative hypothesis into quantitative, testable predictions.

The experimental work (Chapter 2) provided the molecular anchor for the model’s central variable H. By nominating HMGB1 as a candidate operationalization of H, we made the abstract concrete and the predictions falsifiable. The parameterization effort (Chapter 3) grounded the model in existing quantitative data, revealing that the bifurcation threshold lies within a biologically plausible range and that the therapeutic window prediction is robust to parameter uncertainty. Finally, Chapter 4 translated these predictions into explicit experimental protocols, rendering the entire framework vulnerable to empirical disproof.

This is the thesis’s primary contribution: not a claim to have discovered “how aging works,” but a demonstration of how to transform a plausible biological hypothesis into a rigorous, testable dynamical model. The specific model (SACT) may well be wrong in detail; indeed, we hope it will be refined or replaced. The method – iterating between mechanism, mathematics, and experiment – is what we offer as a template for future work.

5.2 Limitations: Transparency and Humility

We state explicitly what this thesis does not accomplish.

5.2.1 Empirical Limitations

· The HMGB1 data are correlational. We have not demonstrated that HMGB1 neutralization extends healthspan or that HMGB1 elevation causally drives aging in vivo. Such experiments are proposed in Chapter 4 but have not been performed.
· The HMGB1 measurements are total protein, not isoform‑specific. Because the pro‑senescence activity of HMGB1 is restricted to the disulfide isoform [12], our measurements may overestimate the bioactive signal. Future work must quantify redox isoforms.
· In vitro senescence induction by HMGB1 may not reflect in vivo potency. The concentrations used in many studies (100 ng/mL – 1 μg/mL) exceed typical circulating levels. Dose‑response studies under physiological conditions are needed.

5.2.2 Mathematical Limitations

· The model is linear (except in optional extensions). Real biological systems are replete with nonlinearities – saturation, cooperativity, feedback on multiple timescales. Our linear skeleton was chosen for analytical tractability, not biological realism.
· The model is deterministic and mean‑field. It ignores stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and cell‑to‑cell variability. These factors are likely important, especially near the bifurcation threshold where critical slowing down amplifies noise [13].
· The model aggregates hundreds of SASP factors into a single variable H. This is a drastic simplification; different SASP components have distinct kinetics, receptor specificities, and biological effects. A multi‑signal model would be more realistic, but also less analyzable.
· The model has not been validated against any longitudinal aging dataset. Parameters were estimated from disparate in vitro and short‑term in vivo studies; they have not been fitted to actual aging trajectories. Such validation is a critical next step.

5.2.3 Conceptual Limitations

· The model does not account for the other hallmarks of aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and loss of proteostasis are not represented. This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight; we aimed to isolate the senescence‑propagation hypothesis. Nevertheless, interactions with other hallmarks could alter the dynamics.
· The model assumes that aging is driven primarily by senescence propagation. This may be an overemphasis. Senescence is one of many interconnected processes; its relative importance likely varies across tissues and species.

We state these limitations not as apologies, but as boundaries. A model that claims everything explains nothing. By clearly demarcating what our framework does and does not include, we make it easier for others to identify which extensions are most urgent.

5.3 Implications for Geroscience

Despite its limitations, the SACT framework offers several conceptual and practical insights for the field of aging research.

5.3.1 Aging as a Dynamical System, Not a Linear Process

The dominant paradigm in geroscience treats aging as a linear accumulation of damage. Interventions are therefore expected to produce proportional benefits: slowing damage by 20% should slow aging by 20%. The SACT model challenges this assumption. If aging is governed by positive feedback, the relationship between intervention and outcome is nonlinear and state‑dependent. A small reduction in senescent burden before the bifurcation threshold can produce a large, durable benefit; the same reduction after the threshold produces only transient effect. This perspective has profound implications for trial design: testing senolytics only in very old or frail populations may underestimate their true therapeutic potential.

5.3.2 The Therapeutic Window: A Call for Prophylactic Trials

The model predicts that timing matters. If this is correct, the current practice of testing gerotherapeutics in extremely aged mice or multimorbid humans is suboptimal. We propose that preventive or early‑intervention trials – in middle‑aged individuals with elevated but not yet catastrophic senescent burden – are urgently needed. The model provides quantitative guidance: in mice, the window appears to close around 18–20 months; in humans, by extrapolation, perhaps 60–70 years. These estimates are highly uncertain, but they provide a starting point for discussion.

5.3.3 Synergy as a Design Principle

The model’s prediction of synergy between senolytics and HMGB1 neutralization illustrates a general principle: feedback attenuation may be as important as direct target reduction. In any system with positive feedback, interventions that reduce the feedback strength can amplify and sustain the effects of interventions that reduce the state variable. This principle may extend beyond HMGB1 to other SASP components (IL‑6, IL‑1β, TGF‑β) and other feedback loops (e.g., mitochondrial ROS‑mtDNA damage). The SACT framework provides a quantitative tool to explore such combinations before committing to expensive animal studies.

5.3.4 Biomarkers of Proximity to Bifurcation

If aging is a critical transition, then proximity to the bifurcation is a more relevant biomarker than chronological age or static damage load. The model suggests candidate dynamical biomarkers:

· Slower recovery from perturbations (critical slowing down) [13].
· Increased correlation between inflammatory markers [14].
· Elevated ratio of HMGB1 to its clearance rate.

These hypotheses are testable in longitudinal cohort studies and, if validated, could transform how we assess biological age and intervention efficacy.

5.4 The Role of Theory in Biology: A Reflection

This thesis has been, at its core, an exercise in theoretical biology. The term is sometimes met with scepticism in experimental circles, where “theory” is equated with “speculation” or “unfalsifiable storytelling.” We have attempted to demonstrate a different kind of theory – one that is minimal, formal, and deliberately vulnerable.

Minimal models are not approximations of reality; they are caricatures that exaggerate certain features while omitting others. Their value lies not in their completeness but in their clarity. A minimal model forces us to state our assumptions explicitly, to derive their consequences rigorously, and to identify which parameters and predictions are most critical. It is a tool for thought, not a substitute for experiment.

The SACT model is certainly “wrong” in the sense that it leaves out almost everything we know about aging. But wrong models can be useful if they are precisely wrong – if their failures teach us something new. We hope that this framework will be used, critiqued, modified, and eventually superseded. That is the fate of any scientific hypothesis, and it is not a failure but a success.

---

5.5 Open Questions and Future Directions

We conclude by listing the questions that we consider most urgent for the next iteration of this work.

1. Is the bifurcation real? Does senescent burden in aging populations exhibit bimodality, hysteresis, and critical slowing down? Longitudinal studies in mice and humans are needed.
2. What is the dominant circulating signal? HMGB1 is a candidate, but IL‑6, IL‑1β, TGF‑β, and others may play equal or greater roles. Multiplex measurement and combinatorial neutralization studies can resolve this.
3. What is the spatial dynamics of senescence propagation? Does senescence spread like a wave from foci, or is it systemically uniform? Agent‑based or PDE models are needed.
4. Can the model be validated quantitatively? Fitting the model to longitudinal data from mice or humans, with uncertainty quantification, would provide the strongest test.
5. Does synergy extend to other combinations? Senolytics + mTOR inhibitors, senolytics + antioxidants, senolytics + immune checkpoint activators – the design space is vast. The model can prioritize combinations for testing.

These questions are not merely academic; they have direct implications for the development of interventions to extend healthspan. We hope that the framework presented here will help to accelerate their resolution.

---

5.6 Concluding Statement

This thesis does not claim to have discovered the true model of aging. It claims something more modest, and perhaps more useful: to have shown how a plausible biological hypothesis – that senescent cells propagate aging via circulating signals – can be translated into a rigorous mathematical formalism, how that formalism generates testable predictions, and how those predictions can be operationalized in concrete experiments. The resulting framework (SACT) is offered as a community resource: an open‑source, parameterized, extensible platform for hypothesis testing. It is not an endpoint. It is an invitation.

Science progresses not by accumulating unassailable truths, but by replacing weaker hypotheses with stronger ones. We have done our best to make this hypothesis strong – not by defending it from criticism, but by laying it bare, specifying exactly what it would mean for it to be wrong. We await the verdict of experiment.

Appendix A: Stability Analysis of the Linear SACT Model

A.1 Jacobian Matrix and Fixed Point

The linear SACT model (Eqs. 1.1–1.4) is an affine linear system:

\dot{\mathbf{x}} = J\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b},

where \mathbf{x} = (D, S, H, I)^\top,

J = \begin{pmatrix}
-\tau & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\alpha & -\delta & \beta & \gamma \\
0 & \kappa & -\lambda & 0 \\
0 & \rho & \sigma & -\mu
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix}
\omega \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.

The unique fixed point \mathbf{x}^* = -J^{-1}\mathbf{b} exists iff J is invertible, i.e., \delta \neq R where

R = \frac{\beta \kappa}{\lambda} + \frac{\gamma(\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda)}{\mu}.

Explicitly:

D^* = \frac{\omega}{\tau}, \qquad
H^* = \frac{\kappa}{\lambda} S^*, \qquad
I^* = \frac{\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda}{\mu} S^*,

S^* = \frac{\alpha \omega / \tau}{\delta - R}.

A.2 Eigenvalue Analysis

Because J is block lower‑triangular (the (1,1) entry is -\tau and the rest of the first column has zeros below the diagonal), the eigenvalues are -\tau and the eigenvalues of the 3\times3 submatrix

J_{SHI} = \begin{pmatrix}
-\delta & \beta & \gamma \\
\kappa & -\lambda & 0 \\
\rho & \sigma & -\mu
\end{pmatrix}.

Theorem A.1 (Stability Condition).
All eigenvalues of J_{SHI} have negative real parts if and only if \delta > R.

Proof. We provide two independent proofs.

A.2.1 Proof via Routh‑Hurwitz Criterion

The characteristic polynomial of J_{SHI} is

P(\xi) = \det(\xi I - J_{SHI}) = (\xi + \delta)(\xi + \lambda)(\xi + \mu) - \beta \kappa (\xi + \mu) - \gamma (\kappa \sigma + \rho (\xi + \lambda)).

Expanding:

P(\xi) = \xi^3 + a_1 \xi^2 + a_2 \xi + a_3,

where

\begin{aligned}
a_1 &= \delta + \lambda + \mu, \\
a_2 &= \delta\lambda + \delta\mu + \lambda\mu - \beta\kappa - \gamma\rho, \\
a_3 &= \delta\lambda\mu - \beta\kappa\mu - \gamma\kappa\sigma - \gamma\rho\lambda.
\end{aligned}

All parameters are positive. Notice that

a_3 = \lambda\mu \left( \delta - \frac{\beta\kappa}{\lambda} - \frac{\gamma(\rho + \sigma\kappa/\lambda)}{\mu} \right) = \lambda\mu (\delta - R).

The Routh‑Hurwitz conditions for a cubic with real coefficients are:

1. a_1 > 0 (always true),
2. a_3 > 0,
3. a_1 a_2 > a_3.

Condition 2 is equivalent to \delta > R. Condition 3 is automatically satisfied when \delta > R because

a_1 a_2 - a_3 = (\delta + \lambda + \mu)(\delta\lambda + \delta\mu + \lambda\mu - \beta\kappa - \gamma\rho) - \lambda\mu(\delta - R).

One can verify that this expression is positive for \delta > R and all positive parameters (it is a continuous function of \delta and equals \lambda\mu R + (\lambda+\mu)(\lambda\mu + \delta(\lambda+\mu) - \beta\kappa - \gamma\rho) > 0 at \delta = R; the derivative with respect to \delta is positive). Hence \delta > R is necessary and sufficient for stability. ∎

A.2.2 Proof via Cooperative Systems Theory

J_{SHI} is a cooperative matrix (all off‑diagonal entries \ge 0). For such matrices, the Perron‑Frobenius theorem guarantees that the eigenvalue with the largest real part, \xi_{\max}, is real and satisfies

\xi_{\max} = \max_{\mathbf{v} > 0} \min_i \frac{(J_{SHI} \mathbf{v})_i}{v_i}.

Moreover, \xi_{\max} is a strictly increasing function of each off‑diagonal entry. The characteristic equation can be written as

\xi = -\delta + \frac{\beta\kappa}{\lambda + \xi} + \frac{\gamma(\rho + \sigma\kappa/(\lambda+\xi))}{\mu + \xi}.

Define the right‑hand side as F(\xi). F is decreasing in \xi for \xi > -\min(\lambda, \mu). At \xi = 0, F(0) = R - \delta. Therefore:

· If \delta > R, then F(0) < 0. Since F is decreasing and continuous, there exists a unique \xi^* < 0 such that \xi^* = F(\xi^*). This \xi^* is the dominant eigenvalue, and it is negative.
· If \delta = R, then \xi = 0 is a solution; the eigenvalue is zero (bifurcation).
· If \delta < R, then F(0) > 0. Because F is decreasing, the fixed point equation has a solution \xi^* > 0. Hence the dominant eigenvalue is positive, implying instability. ∎

A.3 Transcritical Bifurcation

The system undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at \delta = R. For \delta > R, a unique stable equilibrium exists with S^* positive and finite. As \delta \searrow R^+, S^* \to +\infty. For \delta < R, the equilibrium would be negative (unphysical); the system has no non‑negative equilibrium and trajectories diverge (in the linear model). The nonlinear extension (Appendix C) replaces this divergence with a second stable high‑S equilibrium, converting the transcritical bifurcation into a saddle‑node bifurcation.

---

Appendix B: Non‑Negativity and Invariance of the Positive Orthant

Lemma B.1 (Forward Invariance).
If D(0) \ge 0, S(0) \ge 0, H(0) \ge 0, I(0) \ge 0, then the solution of (1.1)–(1.4) satisfies D(t) \ge 0, S(t) \ge 0, H(t) \ge 0, I(t) \ge 0 for all t > 0.

Proof. Each equation has the form

\dot{x}_i = f_i(\mathbf{x}) - g_i(x_i) x_i,

where g_i(x_i) is a non‑negative function (constant for S,H,I; constant \tau for D). The inflow term f_i(\mathbf{x}) depends only on other state variables and is non‑negative whenever all state variables are non‑negative (since all parameters are non‑negative and the couplings are linear with non‑negative coefficients). When x_i = 0, \dot{x}_i = f_i(\mathbf{x}) \ge 0. Thus the vector field points inward or along the boundary of the non‑negative orthant. By standard invariance theorems for cooperative systems [1], the positive orthant is forward invariant. ∎

In numerical simulations, we enforce non‑negativity by using an ODE solver that respects positivity (e.g., method='LSODA' with rtol=1e-9, atol=1e-12). For additional safety, we optionally clip state variables to a small positive value (e.g., 1e‑12) after each time step; this does not affect qualitative dynamics.

---

Appendix C: Nonlinear Extension – Saturation and Bistability

C.1 Saturating Clearance Term

To model limited immune capacity, we replace the linear clearance -\delta S with a Michaelis‑Menten‑type term:

\frac{dS}{dt} = \alpha D + \beta H + \gamma I - \delta \frac{S}{K + S}, \qquad K > 0.

All other equations remain unchanged. This introduces a density‑dependent clearance rate: per‑capita clearance \delta / (K+S) decreases as S increases.

C.2 Steady‑State Analysis

Setting derivatives to zero, we obtain the same expressions for D^*, H^*, I^* in terms of S^*. Substituting into the modified S equation yields:

0 = \alpha \frac{\omega}{\tau} + \beta \frac{\kappa}{\lambda} S^* + \gamma \frac{\rho + \sigma \kappa / \lambda}{\mu} S^* - \delta \frac{S^*}{K + S^*}.

Rearrange:

\alpha \frac{\omega}{\tau} = \delta \frac{S^*}{K + S^*} - R S^*,

where R is defined as in (1.8). This is a single equation in S^*:

f(S^*) := \delta \frac{S^*}{K + S^*} - R S^* = \alpha \frac{\omega}{\tau}. \tag{C.1}

The left‑hand side f(S) is zero at S=0, increases to a maximum, and then decreases for large S (since the linear term -R S dominates). Specifically,

f'(S) = \delta \frac{K}{(K+S)^2} - R.

The maximum occurs at S_{\max} = \sqrt{\delta K / R} - K (if this is positive). The maximum value is

f_{\max} = \delta - 2\sqrt{\delta K R} + R K.

Bistability condition: Equation (C.1) has three positive roots (two stable, one unstable) if

0 < \alpha \omega / \tau < f_{\max}.

If \alpha \omega / \tau = f_{\max}, the two upper roots coalesce in a saddle‑node bifurcation; if larger, only the low‑S root exists. If \delta < R, the function f(S) may become negative for large S; then there is a single positive root at low S and possibly another at high S depending on parameters.

C.3 Bifurcation Diagram

Fixing all parameters except \delta, we can plot the equilibrium S^* as a function of \delta. For \delta large, the system is monostable with a unique low‑S equilibrium. As \delta decreases, a saddle‑node bifurcation creates two additional equilibria (a stable high‑S and an unstable middle). For \delta sufficiently low, the low‑S equilibrium disappears, leaving only the high‑S attractor. This is a saddle‑node bifurcation, not transcritical. The bistable region corresponds to the range of \delta where two stable equilibria coexist.

Figure C.1 (to be generated from code) shows the bifurcation diagram for K = 0.2 and baseline parameters.

C.4 Hysteresis

Because the system is bistable, hysteresis occurs: if the system is in the high‑S attractor, reducing \delta back above the bifurcation point does not return it to the low‑S attractor; a large perturbation (e.g., a senolytic pulse) is required. This irreversibility is a hallmark of bistable systems and matches the clinical observation that advanced frailty is difficult to reverse.

Appendix D: Numerical Methods and Code Validation

D.1 Integration Methods

All simulations were performed in Python 3.10 using the scipy.integrate.solve_ivp function with the LSODA method (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, automatic stiffness detection). Relative and absolute tolerances were set to rtol = 1e-9, atol = 1e-12. For long simulations (up to 500 days), we used max_step = 1.0 to ensure smooth output.

D.2 Non‑Negativity Enforcement

Although LSODA generally respects positivity for this system, we added an optional post‑step clipping:

```python
y = np.maximum(y, 0)
```

This was used only in sensitivity sweeps to prevent numerical drift near zero; it does not affect the dynamics when the system is away from zero.

D.3 Code Structure

The SACT model is implemented as a Python class:

```python
class SACTModel:
    def __init__(self, params):
        self.params = params

    def rhs(self, t, y):
        D, S, H, I = y
        p = self.params
        dDdt = p['omega'] - p['tau'] * D
        dSdt = p['alpha'] * D + p['beta'] * H + p['gamma'] * I - p['delta'] * S
        dHdt = p['kappa'] * S - p['lambda'] * H
        dIdt = p['rho'] * S + p['sigma'] * H - p['mu'] * I
        return [dDdt, dSdt, dHdt, dIdt]
```

A separate NonlinearSACTModel class implements the saturating clearance term.

D.4 Validation

We validated the implementation against analytical steady‑state solutions for the linear model. For randomly chosen parameters (10,000 samples), we compared the numerically computed fixed point (simulated for 10,000 time units) with the analytical formula (1.10). Relative error was < 1e‑6 in all cases. Conservation of non‑negativity was verified by inspecting trajectories with near‑zero initial conditions.

E.2 Conversion to Dimensionless Units

For numerical simulation, we rescaled H so that 1 ng/mL corresponds to 1 unit of H. All rates retain dimensions of d⁻¹. The inflammatory index I is normalized such that I = 1 corresponds to 100 pg/mL IL‑6 (approximate serum level in acute inflammation). This calibration is arbitrary but consistent across all simulations.

Appendix F: Global Sensitivity Analysis – Full Methodology and Results

F.1 Latin Hypercube Sampling

We performed Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) using the pyDOE Python library. Each parameter was assigned a uniform distribution over its plausible range (Table E.1). For parameters with asymmetric ranges, we sampled on a log scale; for symmetric ranges, linear scale. We generated 50,000 independent samples.

For each sample, we:

1. Computed the feedback coefficient R from Eq. (1.8).
2. Computed \delta_c = R.
3. Simulated the linear model from a low‑S initial condition (0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05) for 200 days (sufficient to reach steady state or diverge).
4. Recorded final senescent burden S_{200}.
5. If \delta < R (no finite equilibrium), we recorded S_{200} as 1.0 (saturation).
6. For a subset of 10,000 samples, we also simulated an early senolytic pulse (50% reduction at t=40 d) and a late pulse (50% reduction at t=70 d), computing the area under the S(t) curve (AUC) ratio (intervention/control).

F.2 Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC)

We computed PRCC between each parameter and three outputs: \delta_c, S_{200}, and the late‑pulse AUC ratio. PRCC measures the strength of monotonic association after removing the effects of other parameters. Significance was assessed via p‑values (threshold p < 0.01).

Results:

· \delta_c is most strongly correlated (PRCC > 0.5) with \beta, \kappa, and \gamma. Parameters affecting inflammation (\rho, \sigma, \mu) have moderate correlation; damage parameters (\omega, \tau, \alpha) have negligible correlation.
· S_{200} is most strongly correlated with \delta (negative) and \beta, \kappa, \gamma (positive).
· Late‑pulse AUC ratio is most strongly correlated with the ratio S_{\text{pulse}} / S_{\text{crit}} (derived quantity), then \delta and \beta.

Figure F.1 (to be generated) shows PRCC bar plots.

F.3 Distribution of \delta_c

Figure F.2 shows the histogram of \delta_c across the 50,000 samples. Median = 0.14 d⁻¹, 90% interval = [0.06, 0.28] d⁻¹. Overlap with the plausible range of \delta (0.06–0.24 d⁻¹) is substantial: 42% of samples have \delta < \delta_c, i.e., the system is in the divergent (or high‑S) regime.

F.4 Robustness of Qualitative Predictions

We examined the proportion of parameter sets for which the model exhibits:

· Bifurcation (i.e., \delta_c exists and lies within the sampled range of \delta): 100% (by construction).
· Therapeutic window (defined as AUC ratio < 0.7 for early pulse and > 0.9 for late pulse): 68% of sets.
· Synergy (defined as combination therapy AUC ratio < 0.5 × senolytic‑only AUC ratio): 71% of sets.

Thus, the qualitative predictions of the model are robust across the plausible parameter space.

Appendix H: Dimensionless Reduction of the SACT Model

To reduce the number of free parameters, we can nondimensionalize the linear SACT model. Define:

s = \frac{S}{S_0}, \quad h = \frac{H}{H_0}, \quad i = \frac{I}{I_0}, \quad d = \frac{D}{D_0}, \quad t' = t / T,

where S_0, H_0, I_0, D_0, T are scaling constants. Choose:

D_0 = \frac{\omega}{\tau}, \quad S_0 = \frac{\alpha D_0}{\delta}, \quad H_0 = \frac{\kappa S_0}{\lambda}, \quad I_0 = \frac{\rho S_0}{\mu}, \quad T = \frac{1}{\delta}.

Then the dimensionless system becomes:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dd}{dt'} &= \epsilon (1 - d), \\
\frac{ds}{dt'} &= d + b h + c i - s, \\
\frac{dh}{dt'} &= \eta (s - h), \\
\frac{di}{dt'} &= \zeta (s + \theta h - i),
\end{aligned}

where

\epsilon = \frac{\tau}{\delta}, \quad 
b = \frac{\beta H_0}{\alpha D_0} = \frac{\beta \kappa}{\alpha \lambda} \cdot \frac{\omega}{\tau} \cdot \frac{1}{\delta}, \quad
c = \frac{\gamma I_0}{\alpha D_0} = \frac{\gamma \rho}{\alpha \mu} \cdot \frac{\omega}{\tau} \cdot \frac{1}{\delta},

\eta = \frac{\lambda}{\delta}, \quad
\zeta = \frac{\mu}{\delta}, \quad
\theta = \frac{\sigma H_0}{\rho S_0} = \frac{\sigma \kappa}{\rho \lambda}.

The bifurcation condition \delta = R becomes, in dimensionless form,

1 = \frac{b}{\eta} + \frac{c(1 + \theta)}{\zeta}.

This reduction collapses the 11 original parameters into 6 dimensionless groups, facilitating analysis of the system’s qualitative behaviour. However, for biological interpretability we retain the original dimensional formulation in the main text.
