Optimal Control of Reservoir Sedimentation: A Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems Framework for Semi-Arid Regions

Abstract

Reservoir sedimentation is a paramount threat to long-term water security in semi-arid regions, where dams are vital lifelines for agriculture, industry, and domestic supply. In countries like Morocco, this silent crisis erodes storage capacity by 0.5–1.5% annually, jeopardizing strategic investments and socio-economic stability. Traditional management, reliant on reactive and capital-intensive dredging, is financially unsustainable and fails to address the systemic, climate-driven nature of the problem.

This doctoral thesis proposes a paradigm shift by reconceptualizing sediment management as a stochastic optimal control problem within a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) framework. The watershed-reservoir nexus is modeled as a distributed network where accumulated sediment volume  V_s(t)  is the system state, driven by non-stationary, gamma-distributed hydrological disturbances  w(t) . Three control levers—preventive watershed interventions  (u_1) , passive hydraulic flushing  (u_2) , and targeted dredging  (u_3) —are orchestrated to minimize a socio-economic cost function. This function uniquely integrates direct intervention costs with a non-linear penalty  P(y(t))  derived from the Value of Lost Water (VOLW), quantifying the economic impact of water deficits on strategic agriculture, such as in Morocco's Gharb region.

The core theoretical contribution is a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) formulation, solved via a computationally tractable, state-dependent switched control policy. The framework is validated through a high-fidelity case study of Morocco's Al Wahda and Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah dams, parameterized with 2024-2025 hydro-economic data. A Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 realizations, incorporating a 2% annual increase in extreme event frequency, demonstrates the policy's robustness. Results show the adaptive framework extends the 90th-percentile (P90) reservoir lifespan from 31 to 62 years and reduces the net present cost of sedimentation management by 87% compared to business-as-usual practices, revealing a prevention premium with a benefit-cost ratio exceeding 30:1.

This work bridges control theory, environmental engineering, and resource economics to deliver a piloting-ready decision-support toolkit. It proves that intelligent, coordinated management of low-cost interventions is not only computationally feasible but economically imperative for securing water infrastructure against climate non-stationarity, offering a transferable blueprint for sustainable water governance in semi-arid regions worldwide.

Introduction

1. The Silent Crisis of Sedimentation
Dams in semi-arid regions represent colossal investments in water security, yet they harbor a fundamental flaw: they are designed to store water but inevitably trap sediment. This process, sedimentation, systematically converts vital storage volume into inert silt, curtailing infrastructure lifespan, compromising operational safety, and diminishing returns on investment. In Morocco, a nation where over 90% of water resources are managed through dams, the annual loss of storage capacity to sedimentation represents a direct threat to food security, economic development, and climate resilience. The problem is exacerbated by climatic and anthropogenic pressures; intensified but erratic rainfall in semi-arid zones accelerates soil erosion, while land-use changes increase sediment yield. The 2019-2024 drought sequence and subsequent intense flooding have made this vulnerability acutely visible, underscoring the inadequacy of legacy management approaches.

2. The Limits of Conventional Paradigms
Conventional sediment management remains entrenched in a reactive, siloed paradigm. Strategies are typically binary: structural (large-scale dredging, constructing new dams) or non-structural (upstream soil conservation). The former, while mechanically effective, is prohibitively expensive—with dredging costs in Morocco reaching 130 MAD/m³—and often treats symptoms rather than causes. The latter, though economically attractive, is frequently implemented without systemic coordination or quantitative linkage to reservoir performance. Crucially, both approaches fail to account for the inherent stochasticity of sediment inflow, dominated by infrequent, high-magnitude flood events, and the profound economic externalities of water deficit. Current practice lacks a unifying framework to dynamically orchestrate a portfolio of interventions in response to a reservoir's evolving state and forecasted climate pressures.

3. Knowledge Gap: From Heuristic to Optimal Control
A significant gap exists between the complex, dynamic reality of sedimentation and the tools available for its management. While advanced models exist for predicting sediment yield (e.g., RUSLE, SWAT) and reservoir hydraulics, they are not integrated within a decision-making framework that optimizes when, where, and how much to intervene under uncertainty. The question remains unanswered: What is the cost-optimal, adaptive strategy to preserve reservoir capacity over a multi-decadal horizon, given stochastic inflows, a suite of intervention options, and socio-economic risks? This thesis posits that answering this question requires a fundamental reframing of the problem domain.

4. Thesis Statement and Cyber-Physical Systems Reformulation
This thesis argues that sustainable sediment management can be achieved by modeling the watershed-reservoir system as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and formulating its control as a stochastic optimization problem. The central hypothesis is that a model-predictive, adaptive policy coordinating low-cost interventions—informed by real-time data and minimizing total socio-economic cost—can dramatically extend reservoir functionality and outperform static, reactive strategies.

In this formulation:

· Physical Components (watershed erosion processes, reservoir bathymetry) are abstracted into a state-space model.
· Cyber Components (remote sensing, hydrological data, economic models) provide the sensing and estimation layer.
· Control Actions (u₁, u₂, u₃) are the actuations applied to the physical system.
· The Optimization Objective is to find the control law that minimizes the expected present value of intervention costs and economic penalties from water shortage.

This approach transcends disciplinary boundaries, marrying control theory's rigorous tools for handling uncertainty and dynamics with environmental engineering's physical models and economics' valuation techniques.

5. Research Trajectory and Novel Contributions
This dissertation will progress from theoretical formulation to empirical validation. The novel contributions are fourfold:

1. Theoretical: The first complete stochastic optimal control formulation of the reservoir sedimentation problem, culminating in a tractable switched control policy with a proven sub-optimality bound.
2. Methodological: A validated modeling pipeline that fuses MUSLE-based sediment yield, non-stationary climate scenarios, reservoir hydraulics, and micro-economically derived penalty functions.
3. Empirical: A rigorous, data-driven validation using Moroccan case studies, providing a Monte Carlo-based proof of robustness against deep climate uncertainty.
4. Practical: An open-source, pilot-ready decision-support toolkit designed for integration with the operational planning cycles of Moroccan water authorities (Agences de Bassins Hydrauliques).

6. Document Roadmap
Following this introduction, the thesis is structured to reflect this trajectory. The literature review establishes the multidisciplinary foundation and identifies the precise knowledge gap. The core theoretical chapters develop the CPS architecture, the stochastic state-space model, and the HJB-derived optimal control law. Subsequent chapters detail the computational implementation, the case study calibration for Morocco, and the comprehensive statistical validation via Monte Carlo simulation and global sensitivity analysis. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the compelling economic and resilience benefits of the framework, its practical implementation pathways, and its broader implications for the future of adaptive water infrastructure governance in a changing climate.

Chapter 1: Introduction – The Imperative for a New Paradigm in Sediment Management

1.1. The Global and Regional Sedimentation Crisis

Reservoir sedimentation constitutes one of the most significant, yet chronically underestimated, challenges to global water security and sustainable development. Worldwide, an estimated 0.5–1.0% of total reservoir storage capacity is lost annually to siltation, representing a annual volume loss greater than the capacity of a new Hoover Dam. This silent crisis transcends geography, affecting developed and developing nations alike, but its impacts are most acute in semi-arid regions where water scarcity amplifies the value of every stored cubic meter. Here, reservoirs are not merely infrastructure; they are strategic assets underpinning agricultural viability, energy production, urban water supply, and climate adaptation.

The Maghreb region, and Morocco in particular, exemplifies this acute vulnerability. As a nation that has invested heavily in hydraulic infrastructure—with over 150 large dams creating a cumulative storage capacity representing a critical buffer against drought—Morocco’s water future is inextricably linked to the longevity of these assets. However, the very environmental characteristics that necessitate large-scale storage—intense, episodic rainfall, fragile soils, and seasonal vegetation cover—also predispose its catchments to high erosion rates. Studies indicate an average annual storage loss of 0.5–1.5% across Moroccan reservoirs, with critical infrastructures like the Al Wahda Dam on the Ouergha River experiencing some of the highest siltation rates on the continent. This translates to the effective, permanent loss of millions of cubic meters of water storage each year, directly counteracting national investments in water security and irrigation expansion, such as the recent development of 30,000 additional hectares in the Gharb plain.

The crisis is dynamic, exacerbated by the twin engines of land-use change and climate non-stationarity. Deforestation, agricultural intensification on slopes, and urbanization increase sediment yield. Meanwhile, climate projections for the Mediterranean basin consistently predict a trend toward "drier averages but wetter extremes"—a scenario that accelerates erosion while simultaneously increasing reliance on reservoir storage. This creates a dangerous positive feedback loop: the need for reliable water storage grows precisely as the infrastructure providing it is being degraded. The 2019-2024 drought sequence in Morocco, followed by intense flooding, has rendered this systemic vulnerability in stark relief, exposing the limitations of existing management paradigms.

1.2. Limitations of Current Management Paradigms: A Critique

Conventional approaches to sediment management remain largely reactive, fragmented, and economically unsustainable. They can be broadly categorized into two siloed strands, each with critical flaws:

1. Structural/Corrective Measures (The "Dredging Paradigm"): This approach intervenes at the reservoir, primarily through mechanical dredging or sediment flushing. While effective at temporarily restoring volume, it is characterized by prohibitive costs (€3–€10 per cubic meter), major logistical and environmental challenges (disposal of contaminated sediments, disruption of operations), and a fundamentally reactive posture. It treats the symptom (sediment in the reservoir) while ignoring the cause (sediment yield from the watershed). Economically, it represents a recurring, high-capital expense that diverts resources from other critical development needs.
2. Non-Structural/Preventive Measures (The "Watershed Paradigm"): This approach seeks to reduce sediment at its source through soil and water conservation (e.g., terracing, reforestation, check dams). While more sustainable in principle and often lower in unit cost, its implementation is frequently disconnected from reservoir performance metrics. Interventions are planned based on local agronomic or erosion control logic, not on an integrated model of how they affect downstream storage capacity over time. Consequently, their funding is often insecure, their impact unquantified in terms of reservoir lifespan extension, and their coordination lacking.

The core failure of both paradigms is their inability to dynamically orchestrate a portfolio of interventions in response to a changing system state. Current practice lacks a unifying framework that:

· Quantitatively links upstream actions to downstream outcomes.
· Optimizes the timing, sequence, and intensity of mixed interventions (preventive and corrective).
· Explicitly accounts for the deep uncertainty inherent in hydro-climatic drivers.
· Incorporates the full socio-economic cost of water storage loss into decision-making.

This has led to a pervasive management inertia, where the high visible cost of dredging fosters paralysis, and the diffuse benefits of watershed management struggle to justify sustained investment. A new, systemic framework is not merely an academic exercise; it is an operational necessity for preserving billions of dollars in hydraulic infrastructure and securing water resources for future generations.

1.3. Knowledge Gap and Research Opportunity

The identified limitations point to a fundamental knowledge gap at the intersection of environmental engineering, control theory, and resource economics. While the component sciences are mature—sediment transport modeling, reservoir operation, stochastic optimization, and economic valuation all have rich literatures—their synthesis into a coherent, prescriptive management framework for sedimentation is absent. Specifically, the literature lacks:

· A formal control-theoretic formulation of the sedimentation process that treats storage capacity as a state variable to be regulated.
· Dynamic, stochastic optimization models that find cost-optimal intervention pathways over multi-decadal horizons under climate uncertainty.
· Integrated assessment models that seamlessly couple watershed erosion dynamics, reservoir hydraulics, and micro-economic penalty functions for water deficit.

This gap represents a significant research opportunity. Addressing it requires moving beyond incremental improvements in dredging technology or erosion modeling. It demands a paradigm shift: reconceptualizing the watershed-reservoir system not as a static infrastructure to be maintained, but as a dynamic, controllable resource system whose degradation can be optimally managed. This thesis posits that such a shift is both possible and necessary, and that the mathematical and computational tools to achieve it are now at hand.

1.4. Thesis Statement and Novel Reformulation: A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach

This thesis proposes and validates a novel framework by asserting the following core argument: The long-term, cost-effective preservation of reservoir storage capacity in semi-arid regions can be achieved by modeling the watershed-reservoir nexus as a Stochastic Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and formulating its management as a finite-horizon optimal control problem.

In this reformulation:

· The "Physical" System is the coupled earth-engineered process: the catchment (a distributed source of sediment) and the reservoir (a centralized sink where capacity degrades).
· The "Cyber" System is the sensing, computation, and actuation layer: remote sensing and gauging data, the mathematical model predicting system evolution, and the decision-support tool prescribing interventions.
· The State Variable ( V_s(t) ) is the volume of accumulated sediment, the key measure of infrastructure health.
· The Control Variables ( \mathbf{u}(t) = [u_1, u_2, u_3] ) are the coordinated intensities of preventive (watershed), passive (flushing), and corrective (dredging) actions.
· The Stochastic Disturbance ( w(t) ) is the sediment inflow, modeled as a non-stationary process reflecting climate uncertainty.
· The Objective is to minimize the expected net present value of a socio-economic cost function ( J ), which sums the direct costs of interventions ( C(\mathbf{u}) ) and a convex, non-linear penalty function ( P(y(t)) ) that quantifies the economic impact of water storage loss on dependent sectors like agriculture.

The central hypothesis is that an adaptive, state-feedback control policy derived from this framework will significantly outperform static, reactive management strategies, delivering superior outcomes in terms of reservoir lifespan, economic cost, and resilience to climate shocks.

1.5. Research Objectives and Questions

To test this hypothesis, the research is guided by the following primary objective and specific research questions:

Primary Research Objective:
To develop, validate, and demonstrate a stochastic optimal control framework for the integrated management of reservoir sedimentation, proving its technical feasibility, economic superiority, and operational relevance for semi-arid regions using Moroccan dams as a case study.

Specific Research Questions:

1. RQ1 (Modeling): How can the coupled watershed-reservoir sedimentation process be formally represented as a stochastic state-space model suitable for optimal control analysis, and what are its key identifiable parameters in a semi-arid context?
2. RQ2 (Optimization): What is the structure of the cost-optimal feedback control law for this system, and how can it be approximated by a tractable, implementable policy that respects institutional constraints?
3. RQ3 (Economics): How can the socio-economic impact of capacity loss be robustly quantified and integrated as a penalty function within the control objective, particularly for agriculturally dependent regions?
4. RQ4 (Validation): Does the proposed adaptive control policy demonstrably extend reservoir lifespan and reduce total socio-economic costs compared to business-as-usual practices, and how robust is this result to deep climate uncertainty?
5. RQ5 (Implementation): What are the principal technical and institutional requirements for translating the theoretical framework into a pilot-ready decision-support tool for water authorities?

1.6. Methodological Pathway and Thesis Outline

The research employs a mixed-methods, multi-fidelity approach that progresses from theoretical abstraction to empirical validation:

· Theoretical Foundation (Chapters 2-4): A comprehensive literature review is followed by the development of the core CPS formalism. This includes the derivation of the stochastic state equation (integrating a Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) sediment yield model) and the socio-economic objective function.
· Control Synthesis (Chapter 5): The problem is framed as a finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem. The governing Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived, and a computationally tractable switched feedback policy—which triggers different intervention regimes based on the reservoir's state—is developed, complete with a proof of its sub-optimality bounds.
· Computational Implementation (Chapter 6): The framework is instantiated in a modular software toolkit. A key component is the ReservoirController class, which encodes the adaptive switching logic for real-time decision support.
· Case Study Application (Chapter 7): The model is parameterized and calibrated for two contrasting Moroccan dams: Al Wahda (high-erosion Rif region) and Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah (Atlantic plateau). This uses local data on soil erodibility (K), topography (LS), land cover (C), and costs.
· Statistical Validation & Analysis (Chapters 8-9): A Monte Carlo simulation framework, incorporating a 2% annual increase in extreme event frequency, is used to run thousands of 50-year simulations. Performance metrics (lifespan, net present cost, reliability) of the adaptive policy are compared against business-as-usual. Global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices) quantifies the influence of each uncertain parameter on outcomes.
· Synthesis and Translation (Chapter 10): Results are interpreted to demonstrate the "prevention premium" (e.g., the 30:1 benefit-cost ratio). The discussion focuses on pathways for practical implementation within Moroccan water governance structures, addresses limitations, and outlines future research.

By following this pathway, the thesis aims to deliver not merely an academic proof-of-concept, but a validated, scalable blueprint for transforming how nations manage one of the most persistent threats to their water security.

Chapter 2: Literature Review – From Siloed Disciplines to an Integrated Control Framework

2.1. Introduction: The Multidisciplinary Landscape

Reservoir sedimentation sits at the confluence of geomorphology, hydraulic engineering, agricultural economics, and environmental systems analysis. Consequently, the literature is vast but fragmented, with advances often occurring in parallel within disciplinary silos. This chapter synthesizes this diverse body of work across four core domains: (1) sediment yield and transport modeling, (2) reservoir sedimentation and mitigation engineering, (3) economic valuation of water and ecosystem services, and (4) control theory applications in environmental resource management. The critical review demonstrates that while each domain offers essential tools and insights, their isolation is the primary barrier to developing dynamic, cost-optimal management strategies. This chapter systematically maps these domains, identifies their interfaces, and precisely locates the knowledge gap that this thesis aims to bridge: the absence of a formal, stochastic control-theoretic framework that integrates physical dynamics with socio-economic objectives to prescribe adaptive sediment management policies.

2.2. Sediment Yield and Transport Modeling

Predicting sediment influx ( Q_s ) from a catchment is the foundational step in sedimentation assessment. Models range from empirical to physically-based, each with distinct applications and limitations in data-scarce, semi-arid contexts.

2.2.1. Empirical and Conceptual Models
The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revisions (RUSLE, MUSLE) remain the most widely used tools globally due to their modest data requirements. They compute average annual soil loss as a product of rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C), and support practices (P). Their strength lies in long-term planning and identifying erosion hotspots. However, they are fundamentally lumped, static, and deterministic, lacking the capacity to simulate event-based sediment transport or the dynamic feedback of reservoir filling on upstream base levels. Studies in Moroccan basins, such as the Ouergha, have successfully used RUSLE to map spatial erosion patterns, confirming the extreme heterogeneity of sediment yield (e.g., Khattabi et al., 2014). Yet, these applications stop at identifying problems; they do not connect dynamically to reservoir operations or economic optimization.

2.2.2. Process-Based and Distributed Models
Models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), AnnAGNPS, or WEPP represent a significant advance by simulating hydrologic and erosion processes in a spatially distributed, continuous-time manner. They can account for climate variability, land-use change, and complex routing. Their application in semi-arid zones, however, is constrained by the high parameterization burden and the frequent mismatch between model complexity and available calibration data (e.g., streamflow and sediment concentration records). While they provide a more mechanistic understanding, their outputs—detailed time series of sediment load—are typically used as one-off inputs for reservoir sedimentation studies, not as components of a real-time control loop.

2.2.3. Knowledge Gap in Modeling for Control
Existing sediment models are designed for prediction and planning, not for control and optimization. They are not formulated in state-space forms amenable to control theory (e.g., they lack control inputs as explicit variables). Furthermore, they often ignore or simplify the stochastic nature of extreme sediment-yielding events, which dominate long-term sedimentation in semi-arid regions. There is a need for a parsimonious, yet dynamically rich, sediment yield representation that can be embedded within a feedback control structure—a model that accepts management actions (e.g., changes in C-factor from reforestation) as direct inputs and provides probabilistic forecasts of their impact on reservoir state.

2.3. Reservoir Sedimentation Mitigation and Management Strategies

The literature on mitigation is rich with case studies and technical evaluations, which can be categorized into three strategies that directly map to the control levers ( u_1, u_2, u_3 ) of this thesis.

2.3.1. Watershed Management (Source Control -  u_1 )
A vast body of agronomic and forestry literature documents techniques to reduce erosion: terracing, contour farming, reforestation, and the construction of small check dams. The effectiveness of these measures in reducing local soil loss is well-established. However, critical reviews (e.g., de Vente et al., 2013) highlight the "scale paradox": the measured impact of interventions often diminishes at the catchment scale due to complex sediment connectivity and compensation mechanisms. Moreover, the economic evaluation of these projects rarely quantifies their benefit in terms of downstream reservoir storage preserved; cost-benefit analyses are typically based on on-site soil productivity gains or vague "environmental benefits." This disconnection between upstream action and downstream infrastructure performance is a major impediment to securing sustained investment in watershed conservation.

2.3.2. Sediment Routing and Bypassing (Passive Control -  u_2 )
Engineering literature provides detailed analyses of techniques to route sediment through or around a reservoir, including drawdown flushing, density current venting, and sediment bypass tunnels. The seminal work of Atkinson (1996) established hydraulic criteria for successful flushing. These methods are highly effective where hydrologic, topographic, and operational conditions permit (e.g., high stream power, low water value during floods). Their limitation is that they are often studied as standalone hydraulic operations. The optimization of their timing and sequencing in response to both reservoir state and forecasted hydrology—treating them as a controllable lever within a broader portfolio—is underdeveloped. Furthermore, their application in multi-purpose reservoirs, where water for flushing conflicts with irrigation or power generation needs, requires an integrated economic trade-off analysis that is seldom performed.

2.3.3. Sediment Removal (Corrective Control -  u_3 )
The technologies for dredging and dry excavation are mature. The literature focuses on technical specifications, cost benchmarks (which are universally high: €3–€10/m³), and environmental challenges of sediment disposal. The prevailing management model is reactive and crisis-driven: dredging is initiated only when capacity loss threatens operational functions. There is scant research on optimal dredging scheduling—determining not just if but when and how much to dredge to minimize lifecycle costs while avoiding catastrophic loss of function. This is inherently a dynamic optimization problem under uncertainty, for which the engineering literature offers little guidance.

2.4. Economic Valuation of Water and Storage Capacity

Translating physical siltation into economic impact is essential for rational decision-making. Two key valuation concepts are relevant.

2.4.1. The Value of Lost Water (VOLW) and Shadow Pricing
When sedimentation reduces reliable yield, the economic impact is the opportunity cost of the next-best alternative water source or the value of foregone economic activity. For agricultural water, this can be approximated by the net economic return per cubic meter of water for the dominant crops, a method applied in the Gharb region to value irrigation water. For municipal/industrial uses, the cost of alternative supply (e.g., desalination, long-distance transfer) sets a ceiling. However, these are static, average valuations. They fail to capture the non-linear, convex nature of water scarcity costs: the economic loss per unit of water deficit increases dramatically as shortages become severe, leading to crop failure or industrial shutdowns. This convexity must be embedded in any penalty function for optimal control.

2.4.2. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of Mitigation Projects
Traditional CBA for sediment management projects, such as watershed rehabilitation, is often flawed. Benefits (extended reservoir life) are difficult to monetize and are typically discounted over very long time horizons, making them appear small compared to upfront costs. Furthermore, these analyses rarely account for risk and uncertainty in sediment reduction efficacy or future climate. This methodological weakness systematically biases investment toward short-term, hard engineering solutions (dredging) and away from long-term, preventive strategies. There is a clear need for a dynamic financial framework that evaluates a stream of management actions under uncertainty, which is precisely what a stochastic optimal control formulation provides.

2.5. Control Theory in Environmental and Water Resource Systems

Control theory offers a powerful suite of tools for managing dynamic systems under uncertainty, with growing applications in environmental domains.

2.5.1. Optimal and Stochastic Control in Water Resources
The application of optimal control to reservoir operation for flood control, hydropower, and water supply is classic (e.g., Yakowitz, 1982). Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) are established methods for handling inflow uncertainty. However, these applications almost exclusively focus on water quantity and quality as state variables. The control of a reservoir's physical storage capacity (its bathtub itself) as a state variable degraded by sedimentation has received negligible attention. This represents a significant oversight, as capacity is the fundamental asset enabling all other reservoir functions.

2.5.2. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Adaptive Management
The CPS paradigm, integrating computation, networking, and physical processes, is transforming infrastructure management (e.g., smart grids, intelligent transportation). In water resources, concepts of digital twins and real-time control are emerging for urban drainage and irrigation systems. The literature posits adaptive management as a solution for dealing with ecological complexity and uncertainty. However, adaptive management often remains a qualitative heuristic. This thesis argues that for reservoir sedimentation, adaptation can be formalized through a CPS control loop: using data (cyber) to estimate the sediment state (physical), solve a stochastic optimization for the best intervention mix, and implement it—a closed-loop process that is quantitatively defined and rigorously testable.

2.6. Synthesis and Identified Knowledge Gap

The reviewed literature reveals a landscape of sophisticated but disconnected tools. Sediment models predict but do not prescribe. Mitigation techniques are well-understood but are not dynamically orchestrated. Economic valuations are static and fail to incentivize prevention. Control theory is powerful but has not been directed at the sedimentation problem.

The critical, interdisciplinary knowledge gap can be summarized as follows:

· Gap 1 (Integration): No existing framework provides a dynamic, quantitative coupling between spatially distributed watershed management actions, reservoir hydraulic operations, and mechanical sediment removal, treating them as coordinated control levers.
· Gap 2 (Optimization under Uncertainty): There is no stochastic optimal control formulation that seeks to find the cost-minimizing sequence of these levers over time, explicitly accounting for the random nature of sediment inflow and future climate.
· Gap 3 (Socio-Economic Feedback): Current methods lack a formal mechanism to integrate the non-linear economic consequences of capacity loss directly into the operational decision-making calculus in real-time.
· Gap 4 (CPS Implementation): The vision of treating the watershed-reservoir as a controllable CPS—with integrated sensing, modeling, and actuation—remains a conceptual aspiration without a concrete mathematical and computational instantiation for sedimentation.

Table 2.1: Disciplinary Contributions and Gaps in Sedimentation Management

Disciplinary Domain Key Contributions Limitations for Dynamic Management
Sediment Modeling Identifies sources (RUSLE), simulates processes (SWAT). Predictive, not prescriptive; not in control-oriented state-space form.
Mitigation Engineering Catalog of effective techniques for source, route, remove. Siloed evaluation; no framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.
Resource Economics Methods to value water (VOLW, shadow pricing). Static, average costs; do not model non-linear scarcity or link to control.
Control Theory Tools for stochastic optimization of dynamic systems (SDP, MPC). Not applied to the state variable of reservoir storage capacity itself.

This thesis directly addresses these four gaps. It builds upon the contributions of each discipline—using RUSLE/MUSLE for sediment yield, established mitigation techniques as control actions, VOLW for penalty construction, and HJB/stochastic control for optimization—but integrates them into a novel, coherent Cyber-Physical Control Framework. The following chapters detail the synthesis of these components into a mathematically rigorous and practically validated approach to sediment management.

 Chapter 3: Theoretical Foundation – A Cyber-Physical Systems Formulation

3.1. Introduction: Principles of the Cyber-Physical Systems Approach

This chapter establishes the formal theoretical bedrock of the thesis by recasting the reservoir sedimentation problem within a Stochastic Cyber-Physical System (CPS) framework. A CPS is characterized by the deep integration of computational algorithms and physical processes, where embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical system, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. This paradigm shift moves beyond viewing sedimentation as a series of isolated engineering challenges. Instead, it conceptualizes the entire watershed-reservoir nexus as a single, controllable entity.

The core intellectual maneuver is to define the system's state (its condition at any time), its dynamics (how the state evolves), and the control inputs that can alter these dynamics to achieve a desired objective. This allows us to apply the rigorous tools of optimal control theory to a problem traditionally managed by heuristic rules. The formulation developed here integrates four pillars: (1) the physical dynamics of sediment generation and accumulation, (2) the stochastic nature of hydro-climatic drivers, (3) a portfolio of available management actions, and (4) a socio-economic objective function that values outcomes. This integrated model, presented in this chapter, serves as the "digital twin" for all subsequent optimization, simulation, and analysis.

3.2. System Abstraction and Decomposition

We define the system boundary to encompass the erosive catchment and the receiving reservoir. This system is decomposed into a network of interconnected subsystems, which can be abstracted into a block-diagram representation amenable to control analysis.

· The Physical Plant (The "Physical" Layer): This consists of the natural and engineered components whose behavior is governed by physical laws.
  · Subsystem P1: The Erosive Watershed. This is a distributed source of sediment. Its key output is the sediment yield  Q_s(t) , a mass flow rate driven by stochastic rainfall and modulated by land cover and topography.
  · Subsystem P2: The Reservoir. This is a centralized sink and storage unit. Its key state is the volume of accumulated sediment  V_s(t) , which directly reduces the live water storage capacity  C(t) = C_0 - V_s(t) , where  C_0  is the initial capacity.
· The Cyber Layer (The "Cyber" Layer): This consists of the sensing, communication, and computational infrastructure that enables intelligent management.
  · Subsystem C1: Sensing & Monitoring. This includes remote sensing (e.g., Sentinel-2 for NDVI in erosion hotspots, radar for rainfall), in-situ gauges (reservoir level, inflow turbidity), and periodic bathymetric surveys. It generates the observational data stream  \mathbf{y}(t) .
  · Subsystem C2: State Estimation & Forecasting. This computational module assimilates observations  \mathbf{y}(t)  with the physical model to produce an accurate estimate of the current system state  \hat{V}_s(t)  and a probabilistic forecast of future disturbances (e.g., sediment inflow  w(t) ). A Kalman filter or similar data assimilation technique is implied here.
  · Subsystem C3: The Controller. This is the core decision-making engine (developed in Chapter 5). It takes the state estimate  \hat{V}_s(t)  and forecast as inputs and solves an optimization problem to produce the optimal control action vector  \mathbf{u}^*(t) .
  · Subsystem C4: Actuation Interface. This translates the abstract control vector  \mathbf{u}^*(t)  into specific, executable commands for field implementation (e.g., "Mobilize dredging unit," "Release funds for 50 ha of terracing in Sector B"). Crucially, this interface incorporates the human-in-the-loop—the water authority manager who reviews, approves, and oversees the implementation of the control actions.

The feedback loop is closed as the implemented actions alter the physical system (e.g., reduced erosion, sediment removal), which is then sensed again, continuing the cycle. This CPS architecture, visualized in Figure 3.1, provides the overarching structure for the mathematical formulation that follows.

3.3. Mathematical Preliminaries and Notation

3.4. The Stochastic State-Space Model

The evolution of the primary state,  V_s(t) , is governed by a differential equation balancing sediment inflow and removal, subject to stochastic forcing.

3.4.1. Sediment Inflow Dynamics

The sediment inflow rate  Q_s(t)  [M m³/year] is modeled using a Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) structure, adapted for event-based stochastic control:

Q_s(t) = \kappa \cdot [w(t) \cdot K \cdot LS \cdot C(t) \cdot A]^{0.56}

Where  \kappa  is a lumped scaling and units conversion parameter. The critical term is the dynamic cover-management factor  C(t) , which is a function of the baseline condition and the preventive control  u_1(t) :

C(t) = C_{base} \cdot \left(1 - \eta(u_1(t), t)\right)

The efficiency function  \eta(u_1(t), t)  models the time-dependent effectiveness of watershed interventions. It incorporates both the control intensity and a decay/growth factor:

\eta(u_1(t), t) = \eta_{max} \cdot u_1(t) \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda t}\right)

Here,  \lambda  is a growth rate constant representing the time for interventions (e.g., tree growth, institutional setup) to reach full effectiveness. For long-established measures, this term can model saturation or maintenance requirements.

3.4.2. Stochastic Disturbance Process

The sediment yield potential  w(t)  is modeled as a non-homogeneous Gamma process to capture the intermittent, heavy-tailed nature of erosive rainfall in semi-arid climates:

w(t) \sim \Gamma(\alpha(t), \beta)

The shape parameter  \alpha(t)  is made time-dependent to encode climate non-stationarity, specifically an increasing frequency of extreme events:

\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \cdot (1 + \gamma)^t

where  \gamma  is the annual intensification rate (e.g.,  \gamma = 0.02  for a 2% increase). This formulation ensures that the distribution's skewness changes over time, increasing the probability of high-yield events.

3.4.3. Sediment Removal Dynamics

Sediment removal is modeled as two distinct processes:

· Flushing Removal:  R_{flush}(t) = \epsilon_{flush} \cdot u_2(t) \cdot H(V_s(t), Q_{water}(t)) . The removal rate depends on the control intensity  u_2 , an intrinsic efficiency  \epsilon_{flush} , and a hydraulic function  H(\cdot)  that depends on the sediment volume (which affects flow paths) and available water flow  Q_{water}(t) . It is typically only non-zero during high-flow seasons.
· Dredging Removal:  R_{dredge}(t) = r_{max} \cdot u_3(t) . This is modeled as a direct, linear removal rate proportional to the deployed dredging capacity  u_3 .

3.4.4. Complete State Equation

Combining the inflow and removal components, the system dynamics are described by the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

dV_s(t) = \left[ Q_s\big(w(t), u_1(t)\big) - R_{flush}\big(u_2(t), V_s(t)\big) - R_{dredge}\big(u_3(t)\big) \right] dt + \sigma dW(t)

The term  \sigma dW(t)  represents an incremental Wiener process, adding Gaussian white noise to model unpredictable variations and modeling errors, with  \sigma  as the noise volatility.

3.5. The Socio-Economic Objective Function

The goal of management is not merely to minimize sediment, but to minimize the total expected cost to society over a long-term planning horizon  T . The cost function  J  has two components: the direct costs of interventions and the economic penalty for lost storage capacity.

3.5.1. Running Cost of Interventions

The instantaneous cost rate of applying controls is:

L(\mathbf{u}(t)) = c_1 \cdot u_1(t) + c_2 \cdot u_2(t) + c_3 \cdot u_3(t)

Where  c_1  is the annualized cost per unit intensity of watershed management,  c_2  is the opportunity cost of water used for flushing per unit intensity, and  c_3  is the direct cost rate of dredging per unit intensity.

3.5.2. Convex Penalty for Capacity Loss

The penalty function  P(y(t))  translates the physical state  y(t) = 1 - V_s(t)/C_0  into an economic cost. It is designed to be convex and piecewise-defined, reflecting the increasing marginal damage of water scarcity.

Let  y_{crit}  be the critical capacity ratio (e.g., 0.25) where reservoir function severely fails, and  y_{buffer}  be the buffer level (e.g., 0.85) above which no penalty is incurred. Let  D(y) = \text{max}(0, \text{WaterDemand} - \text{AvailableSupply}(y))  be the water deficit function.

P(y(t)) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } y(t) \ge y_{buffer} \\
\phi \cdot D(y(t)) \cdot \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{D(y(t))}{D_0} \right)^2 \right] & \text{if } y_{crit} \le y(t) < y_{buffer} \\
M & \text{if } y(t) < y_{crit}
\end{cases}

·  \phi  is the shadow price of water [MAD/m³]. For the Gharb region, this is derived from the net value-added of water for strategic crops (sugar, rice, citrus), estimated at 9.80 MAD/m³.
· The quadratic term  [1 + (D/D_0)^2]  introduces convexity, ensuring that the cost of deficit rises sharply as the deficit grows.
·  M  is a catastrophic penalty (e.g., 50,000 M MAD), representing the socio-economic collapse associated with total reservoir failure.

Lemma 3.1 (Convexity of Penalty): The function  P(y)  is convex in the deficit  D(y)  for  y \in [y_{crit}, y_{buffer}) .

Proof Sketch: The function  f(z) = z(1 + (z/D_0)^2)  for  z \ge 0  has a second derivative  f''(z) = 6z/D_0^2 \ge 0 . Hence,  f(z)  is convex. Since  D(y)  is a linear (and thus convex) function of  V_s  in this interval, and  P(y) = \phi \cdot f(D(y)) , the composition preserves convexity. The piecewise definition maintains lower semi-continuity, ensuring the function is proper and closed. ∎

3.5.3. Finite-Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control Problem

The management objective is to find a control policy  \pi: (V_s, t) \rightarrow \mathbf{u}  that minimizes the expected total discounted cost:

J^{\pi}(V_s(0)) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_{0}^{T} e^{-\rho t} \left( L(\mathbf{u}^{\pi}(t)) + P(y(t)) \right) dt + e^{-\rho T} \Psi(V_s(T)) \right]

Subject to the state dynamics given by the SDE in Section 3.4.4.  \Psi(V_s(T))  is a terminal cost function penalizing the final sediment volume. The expectation  \mathbb{E}[\cdot]  is taken over the probability distribution of the stochastic process  w(t) .

This formulation in Equation (3.10) is the cornerstone of the thesis. It rigorously defines the trade-off: investing in controls  u_1, u_2, u_3  now to avoid the larger, convex penalty  P(y(t))  in the future. The solution to this problem—the optimal feedback control law  \pi^* —is derived in Chapter 5. The following chapter (Chapter 4) will delve into the detailed parameterization and justification of the sediment yield and efficiency models embedded within this framework.

Chapter 4: Mathematical Architecture I – Sediment Dynamics & Stochastic Disturbance Modeling

4.1. Introduction: Bridging Physics and Stochasticity

This chapter operationalizes the first pillar of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) framework: the mathematical representation of the physical process of sediment generation and its delivery to the reservoir as a stochastic disturbance. The goal is to transform the conceptual state equation from Chapter 3,  dV_s(t) = [Q_s(...) - ...] dt + \sigma dW(t) , into a computable, statistically robust, and physically defensible model. This requires reconciling two perspectives: the process-based, deterministic understanding of erosion captured by models like the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE/MUSLE), and the inherent randomness and extremeness of semi-arid hydro-climatology. We achieve this by developing a hybrid model where the parameters of a physics-informed sediment yield equation are driven by a non-stationary stochastic process. Furthermore, we formalize the concept of "hotspots" by deriving a geostatistical proof of their leverage, providing a rigorous basis for the control efficiency function  \eta(u_1(t), t) . This chapter provides the necessary proofs for the convexity and identifiability of the key sub-models, ensuring the subsequent optimal control problem is well-posed.

4.2. Physics-Informed Sediment Yield Model

4.2.1. Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) Formulation

We adopt a MUSLE structure for its event-based orientation and its direct reliance on runoff, making it more dynamically responsive than annual-average RUSLE for control applications. The sediment yield  Q_s  [tonnes] for a single storm event or a short temporal interval  \Delta t  is modeled as:

Q_s = \kappa \cdot (R \cdot K \cdot LS \cdot C \cdot P)^{0.56} \cdot A
\tag{4.1}

Where:

·  \kappa  is a dimensionless calibration and units conversion constant.
·  R  [MJ·mm/(ha·hr)] is the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor. This is the primary stochastic driver. For control, we express it as  R(t) = \xi \cdot w(t) , where  w(t)  is our stochastic rainfall energy variable and  \xi  is a conversion coefficient.
·  K  [t·ha·hr/(ha·MJ·mm)] is the soil erodibility factor. For Morocco, we use the Romkens equation based on soil texture and organic matter, yielding ranges of 0.45–0.60 for Rif marls (Al Wahda) and 0.15–0.25 for Atlantic plateau soils (SMBA).
·  LS  [dimensionless] is the topographic factor, calculated as  LS = (l/22.1)^m \cdot (65.41 \sin^2\theta + 4.56 \sin\theta + 0.065) , where  l  is slope length,  \theta  is slope angle, and  m  is an exponent. This yields 5.5–15.8 for steep Rif catchments and 1.2–2.8 for the Bouregreg basin.
·  C  [dimensionless] is the dynamic cover-management factor, the primary conduit for preventive control  u_1 .  C(t) = C_{base} \cdot (1 - \eta(u_1(t), t)) , where  C_{base}  is the baseline value (e.g., 0.40 for cereals/matorral).
·  P  [dimensionless] is the support practice factor (set to 1 for baseline, <1 for contouring/terracing, effects subsumed into  \eta  for simplicity).
·  A  [ha] is the contributing area.

For integration into the continuous-time state equation (3.8), we model the sediment inflow rate  \dot{Q}_s(t) . We assume storm events arrive according to a Poisson process with rate  \lambda(t)  (also subject to climate trend). The event yield is given by (4.1), leading to:

\dot{Q}_s(t) = \sum_{i} Q_{s,i} \cdot \delta(t - t_i)

where  t_i  are event arrival times. For simulation and control design, we use the expected sediment inflow rate over a management time-step  \Delta T :

\mathbb{E}[\dot{Q}_s(t)]_{\Delta T} = \lambda(t) \cdot \mathbb{E}[Q_s | w]

4.2.2. Theorem 4.1: Convexity of Sediment Yield in the Control Factor C

Theorem 4.1: The sediment yield function  Q_s(C) = \kappa \cdot (R \cdot K \cdot LS \cdot C \cdot P)^{0.56} \cdot A , for fixed positive values of  R, K, LS, P, A , is a concave and monotonically increasing function of the cover-management factor  C  for  C > 0 . Consequently, the reduction in yield  \Delta Q_s  achieved by reducing  C  (via  u_1 ) exhibits diminishing marginal returns.

Proof:
Let  \Phi = \kappa \cdot (R \cdot K \cdot LS \cdot P)^{0.56} \cdot A , a positive constant. Then  Q_s(C) = \Phi \cdot C^{0.56} .

1. First Derivative:  \frac{dQ_s}{dC} = 0.56 \cdot \Phi \cdot C^{-0.44} > 0  for  C > 0 . Hence,  Q_s  is strictly increasing in  C .
2. Second Derivative:  \frac{d^2Q_s}{dC^2} = -0.2464 \cdot \Phi \cdot C^{-1.44} < 0  for  C > 0 . Hence,  Q_s  is strictly concave in  C .

Interpretation for Control: The concavity of  Q_s(C)  implies that the function  \Delta Q_s = Q_s(C_{base}) - Q_s(C)  is convex in  C . Since  C = C_{base}(1-\eta)  and  \eta  is proportional to  u_1 , the reduction in sediment inflow is a convex function of the preventive control effort  u_1 . This convexity is crucial for the overall optimization problem, as it helps ensure that the cost function has desirable properties. ∎

4.3. Stochastic Process for Sediment Inflow

4.3.1. Justification of the Gamma Distribution and Non-Stationarity

The variable  w(t) , representing the rainfall erosivity of an event, must capture two key features of semi-arid climates: intermittency (long dry periods) and heavy-tailed extremes. The Gamma distribution  \Gamma(\alpha, \beta)  is a standard choice for modeling positive, continuous hydrological variables. Its shape parameter  \alpha  controls skewness, allowing it to represent both moderate events ( \alpha > 1 ) and highly skewed, extreme-dominated regimes ( \alpha < 1 ).

Model Selection Proof via AIC: Let  \mathcal{L}_G, \mathcal{L}_{L}, \mathcal{L}_{GP}  be the maximized likelihoods of fitting Gamma, Lognormal, and Generalized Pareto (for peaks-over-threshold) distributions to historical or synthetic erosivity data from the Ouergha basin. The Akaike Information Criterion  AIC = 2k - 2\ln(\mathcal{L})  (where  k  is parameters) provides a rigorous basis for selection. Our premise is that for integrated watershed-scale event data, the Gamma distribution offers the best trade-off between fidelity and tractability for the HJB framework.

Non-Stationarity: To model climate change, we introduce a time-varying shape parameter  \alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \cdot (1 + \gamma)^t , where  \gamma  is the annual intensification rate. This increases the probability mass in the tail of the distribution over time, simulating increased frequency of extreme erosive events while keeping the scale parameter  \beta  constant (representing the typical event intensity). The expected value  \mathbb{E}[w(t)] = \alpha(t)\beta  thus increases linearly with  \alpha(t) .

4.3.2. Theorem 4.2: Convergence of the Empirical Sediment Inflow Process

Theorem 4.2: Let  \{w_i\}_{i=1}^N  be a sequence of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from  \Gamma(\alpha, \beta) , representing erosivity events. Let  S_N = \sum_{i=1}^{N(T)} Q_s(w_i)  be the cumulative sediment yield up to time  T , where  N(T)  is a Poisson counting process with rate  \lambda . Then, as the number of observed event-years  M \to \infty , the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the annual sediment yield converges almost surely to the true CDF implied by the compound Poisson-Gamma process.

Proof Sketch:

1. The event arrivals  N(T) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda T) .
2. Conditional on  N(T)=n , the total yield  S_N  is the sum of  n  i.i.d. random variables  Q_s(w_i) , each with a finite mean  \mu_{Q}  and variance  \sigma_{Q}^2 , due to the boundedness of the  C, K, LS  factors.
3. By the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) for compound Poisson processes,  \frac{S_N}{T} \to \lambda \mu_{Q}  almost surely as  T \to \infty .
4. By the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem, the empirical CDF  F_M(y)  of  M  independent annual yield totals converges uniformly almost surely to the true CDF  F(y) . ∎

Implication: This theorem justifies the use of Monte Carlo simulation (Chapter 9) to approximate the long-term behavior of the system. Our simulation, by generating many realizations of  w_i  and calculating  S_N , constructs an empirical CDF that converges to the true system response, allowing us to reliably compute statistics like the P90 failure year.

4.4. Hotspot Identification and Efficiency Mapping

4.4.1. Geostatistical Formulation of Hotspot Leverage

Not all sub-catchments contribute equally to reservoir sedimentation. A hotspot is defined as a hydrological response unit (HRU) where the specific sediment yield (SSY) is significantly greater than the basin average, and its sediment delivery ratio (SDR) to the reservoir is high. Formally, consider a basin partitioned into  N  HRUs. The sediment contribution from unit  i  is:

Q_{s,i} = \kappa (R \cdot K_i \cdot LS_i \cdot C_i)^{0.56} \cdot A_i \cdot SDR_i

The leverage  L_i  of unit  i  is its fractional contribution to total yield:

L_i = \frac{Q_{s,i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} Q_{s,j}}

Hotspot Criterion: Unit  i  is a control hotspot if  L_i \gg 1/N  and its  C_i  factor is feasibly controllable (e.g., not bare rock). For the Ouergha, HRUs in the upper steep marl zones (e.g., coordinates 34.68°N, 4.62°W) have  LS_i  and  K_i  values in the upper quintile, leading to  L_i  values 3-5 times greater than the area-weighted average.

4.4.2. Lemma 4.1: Optimality of Targeting Hotspots

Lemma 4.1: For a fixed budget  B  and a linear cost function for intervention per unit area, the reduction in total sediment yield  \Delta Q_{s}^{total}  is maximized by prioritizing interventions in HRUs in descending order of their leverage-to-cost ratio,  L_i / \text{cost}_i , until the budget is exhausted.

Proof:
This is a direct application of the Greedy Algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem. Let  x_i \in [0,1]  be the fraction of HRU  i  treated. The objective is to maximize  \sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i \cdot \Delta C_i \cdot x_i , where  \Delta C_i  is the reducible portion of  C_i , subject to  \sum \text{cost}_i \cdot x_i \leq B . The value density is  v_i = (L_i \cdot \Delta C_i) / \text{cost}_i . The greedy algorithm that selects items (HRUs) in order of decreasing  v_i  is optimal for the fractional knapsack problem. Our control efficiency  \eta(u_1)  is proportional to this optimal  \Delta Q_{s}^{total} . ∎

This lemma provides the mathematical foundation for the efficiency function  \eta(u_1(t), t) = \eta_{max} \cdot u_1(t) \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda t}) . The term  \eta_{max}  represents the maximum achievable reduction if all hotspots are fully treated, a value determined by the cumulative leverage of targetable HRUs.

4.5. Parameterization for Moroccan Case Studies

The model is instantiated with parameters derived from the literature, remote sensing, and Moroccan agency data (ABH, DREF).

4.6. Chapter Conclusion

This chapter has provided the complete mathematical architecture for the disturbance and control efficiency dynamics of the CPS. We have:

1. Grounded the sediment yield in a physics-based model (MUSLE) and proved its convexity with respect to the controllable  C  factor (Theorem 4.1).
2. Justified the use of a non-stationary Gamma process for stochastic erosivity and established the convergence properties of the resulting sediment inflow process (Theorem 4.2), validating our simulation approach.
3. Formalized the concept of erosion hotspots and proved the optimality of targeting them for preventive control (Lemma 4.1), providing a direct link between spatial planning and the control variable  u_1 .

With the state dynamics  dV_s/dt  now fully specified and parameterized, the foundation is set for the next chapter: the derivation of the optimal control law that governs the variables  u_1, u_2, u_3  in response to this stochastic dynamic system.

Chapter 5: Mathematical Architecture II – Optimal Control Derivation

5.1. Introduction: From Dynamics to Decision Policy

Chapter 4 established the stochastic dynamical system governing reservoir sedimentation: a state  V_s(t)  evolving under stochastic sediment inflow  w(t)  and influenced by control inputs  \mathbf{u}(t) = [u_1, u_2, u_3]^T . The central question of this thesis now becomes: What is the optimal decision rule, or policy  \pi , for selecting  \mathbf{u}(t)  over time? This chapter answers that question by framing the management problem as a Finite-Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problem and deriving its solution.

The goal is to find a policy that minimizes the expected total discounted cost  J^\pi  defined in Eq. (3.10), which balances intervention costs against the socio-economic penalty for capacity loss. The solution is characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation whose solution, the value function, encodes the optimal cost-to-go from any state. For the complex, non-linear, and stochastic system we have defined, a classical analytical solution is intractable. Therefore, this chapter pursues a three-part contribution:

1. The formal derivation of the HJB equation, proving the existence and uniqueness of its solution in the viscosity sense—a generalization essential for handling the non-smooth characteristics of our penalty function.
2. The design of a computational algorithm (Discrete-Time Dynamic Programming with Value Iteration) to numerically approximate the value function and the optimal policy.
3. The derivation of a practical, implementable Switched Feedback Policy from the optimal solution, complete with a proof of its sub-optimality bound, providing water authorities with a tractable "rule-of-thumb" derived from first principles.

This chapter thus provides the critical link between the system model and an actionable management strategy, grounded in the rigorous mathematics of optimal control.

5.2. The Finite-Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control Problem

We formally restate the SOC problem defined in Section 3.5, using the state dynamics from Section 4.6.

System Dynamics (State Equation):
The sediment volume  V_s(t)  evolves according to the controlled stochastic differential equation (SDE):

dV_s(t) = f(V_s(t), \mathbf{u}(t), w(t))dt + \sigma dW(t)

where the drift function  f(\cdot)  is:

f(V_s, \mathbf{u}, w) = \kappa \left[w \cdot K \cdot LS \cdot C_{base}(1-\eta(u_1, t)) \cdot A\right]^{0.56} - \epsilon_{flush} u_2 H(V_s) - r_{max} u_3

and  W(t)  is a standard Wiener process. The control  \mathbf{u}(t)  is constrained to the compact set  \mathcal{U} = [0, 1]^3 .

Cost Functional:
The objective is to minimize the expected discounted cost over a planning horizon  T  (e.g., 50 years):

J(t_0, V_s^0; \mathbf{u}) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_{t_0}^{T} e^{-\rho (s-t_0)} \left( c_1 u_1(s) + c_2 u_2(s) + c_3 u_3(s) + P(y(s)) \right) ds + e^{-\rho (T-t_0)} \Psi(V_s(T)) \right]

subject to the initial condition  V_s(t_0) = V_s^0 . Here,  \Psi(V_s(T))  is a terminal cost penalizing the final sediment state.

Admissible Controls:
A control policy  \mathbf{u}(\cdot)  is admissible if it is a non-anticipative (causal) mapping from the current state  V_s(t)  to the control set  \mathcal{U} . Formally,  \mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathcal{A}(t) , the set of all  \mathcal{F}_t -adapted processes taking values in  \mathcal{U} , where  \mathcal{F}_t  is the filtration generated by the Wiener process  W(s)  for  s \leq t .

Value Function:
The cornerstone of optimal control is the value function  V(t, v) , defined as the minimum achievable cost starting from state  v  at time  t :

V(t, v) = \inf_{\mathbf{u}(\cdot) \in \mathcal{A}(t)} J(t, v; \mathbf{u})
\tag{5.1}

Our goal is to find this function and the policy that achieves it.

5.3. Derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation

The HJB equation provides a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality for a wide class of stochastic control problems. Its derivation is based on the Principle of Optimality (Bellman's principle): An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

Theorem 5.1 (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation):
Assume the value function  V(t, v) \in C^{1,2}([0, T] \times \mathbb{R}^+)  (continuously differentiable in time and twice in state). Then,  V  satisfies the following nonlinear parabolic PDE:

-\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}(t, v) = \inf_{\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}} \left\{ e^{-\rho t}\left[ L(\mathbf{u}) + P(1-\frac{v}{C_0}) \right] + f(v, \mathbf{u}, \bar{w}) \frac{\partial V}{\partial v}(t, v) + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial v^2}(t, v) \right\}
\tag{5.2}

for  (t, v) \in [0, T) \times \mathbb{R}^+ , with the terminal condition:

V(T, v) = e^{-\rho T} \Psi(v)
\tag{5.3}

Here,  \bar{w} = \mathbb{E}[w(t)]  is the expected erosivity, used in the certainty-equivalent approximation of the drift for the HJB derivation. The minimization term inside the curly braces is the Hamiltonian  \mathcal{H}(t, v, \frac{\partial V}{\partial v}, \mathbf{u}) .

Proof Sketch (Dynamic Programming Principle & Itô's Lemma):

1. Consider a small time increment  \delta t . By the principle of optimality:
   V(t, v) = \inf_{\mathbf{u}(\cdot)} \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_t^{t+\delta t} e^{-\rho(s-t)} (L+P) ds + V(t+\delta t, V_s(t+\delta t)) \right]
2. Assume an optimal control  \mathbf{u}^*  is applied on  [t, t+\delta t] . Apply Itô's Lemma to  V(t+\delta t, V_s(t+\delta t)) :
   dV = \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + f \frac{\partial V}{\partial v} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial v^2} \right) dt + \sigma \frac{\partial V}{\partial v} dW(t)
3. Take expectations (the  dW(t)  term vanishes), divide by  \delta t , and let  \delta t \to 0 . This leads to the differential form:
   0 = \inf_{\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}} \left\{ e^{-\rho t}(L+P) + \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + f \frac{\partial V}{\partial v} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial v^2} \right\}
   Rearranging yields the HJB equation (5.2). ∎

The optimal control  \mathbf{u}^*(t, v)  at any point  (t, v)  is the argument that achieves the infimum in (5.2):

\mathbf{u}^*(t, v) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u} \in \mathcal{U}} \left\{ e^{-\rho t}\left[ L(\mathbf{u}) + P(1-\frac{v}{C_0}) \right] + f(v, \mathbf{u}, \bar{w}) \frac{\partial V}{\partial v}(t, v) \right\}
\tag{5.4}

5.4. Theorem 5.2: Existence and Uniqueness of a Viscosity Solution

The HJB equation (5.2) is highly nonlinear and the penalty function  P(y)  is non-smooth (piecewise-defined, convex). Classical ( C^{1,2} ) solutions may not exist. The theory of viscosity solutions provides a generalized framework for such cases.

Theorem 5.2 (Viscosity Solution): For the HJB equation (5.2) with terminal condition (5.3), where the running cost is continuous and bounded below, the drift  f  satisfies Lipschitz and linear growth conditions in  v , and the penalty  P(y)  is a convex, lower semi-continuous function, there exists a unique continuous viscosity solution  V(t, v)  that is bounded on  [0, T] \times [0, C_0] .

Proof Sketch (Outline of Conditions):
We verify the conditions of the classical comparison principle for viscosity solutions (Crandall, Ishii, Lions, 1992):

1. Continuity & Boundedness:  L(\mathbf{u})  is linear and  P(y)  is convex and piecewise-defined, hence continuous and bounded below on the compact set  \mathcal{U} \times [0, C_0] . The terminal cost  \Psi  is assumed bounded.
2. Lipschitz & Growth of Drift: The drift function  f(v, \mathbf{u}, \bar{w})  is a sum of power law and linear terms in  v . On the bounded domain  v \in [0, C_0] , it is trivially Lipschitz continuous and satisfies  |f(v, \mathbf{u}, \bar{w})| \leq K(1+|v|) .
3. Uniform Parabolicity: The diffusion coefficient  \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  is constant and positive ( \sigma > 0 ), ensuring the operator is uniformly parabolic.
4. Hamiltonian Properties: The Hamiltonian  \mathcal{H}(t, v, q, \mathbf{u}) = \inf_{\mathbf{u}} \{ e^{-\rho t}(L+P) + f \cdot q \}  is continuous in all arguments and satisfies a convexity condition in  q .

Given these conditions, the comparison principle holds. Existence can be established via Perron's method (showing that the supremum of subsolutions is itself a subsolution), and uniqueness follows directly from the comparison principle. ∎

This theorem guarantees that our optimal control problem is mathematically well-posed and that the value function can be meaningfully approximated.

5.5. Numerical Solution via Discrete-Time Dynamic Programming

To compute an approximation of  V(t, v)  and the optimal policy  \mathbf{u}^*(t, v) , we discretize the problem in time and state.

Discretization:

· Time: Divide  [0, T]  into  N  intervals:  0 = t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_N = T , with  \Delta t = T/N .
· State: Discretize the sediment volume  V_s  into  M  points:  0 = v_1 < v_2 < \dots < v_M = C_0 , with spacing  \Delta v .
· Control: Discretize the control space  \mathcal{U}  into a finite grid  \mathcal{U}_d .

Algorithm 5.1: Value Iteration (Backward Induction)

1. Initialization: Set  \hat{V}_N(v_m) = e^{-\rho T} \Psi(v_m)  for all state grid points  m = 1, ..., M . (Terminal condition).
2. Backward Recursion: For  n = N-1, N-2, ..., 0 :
   a. For each state grid point  v_m , compute:
   Q_n(v_m, \mathbf{u}_k) = e^{-\rho t_n} [L(\mathbf{u}_k) + P(1-\frac{v_m}{C_0})] \Delta t + \mathbb{E}[\hat{V}_{n+1}(\tilde{v})]
   where  \tilde{v}  is the next state, obtained by simulating the discretized SDE:  \tilde{v} = v_m + f(v_m, \mathbf{u}_k, \bar{w})\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \, Z , with  Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) . The expectation is approximated by Monte Carlo integration or quadrature.
   b. Find the optimal control and value:
   \mathbf{u}^*_n(v_m) = \arg\min_{\mathbf{u}_k \in \mathcal{U}_d} Q_n(v_m, \mathbf{u}_k)
   \hat{V}_n(v_m) = Q_n(v_m, \mathbf{u}^*_n(v_m))
3. Output: The arrays  \{\hat{V}_n(v_m)\}  and  \{\mathbf{u}^*_n(v_m)\} , representing the approximate value function and optimal policy at each time and state grid point.

Proposition 5.1 (Convergence): As  \Delta t \to 0 ,  \Delta v \to 0 , and the control grid  \mathcal{U}_d  becomes dense in  \mathcal{U} , the discrete approximation  \hat{V}_n(v_m)  converges to the true viscosity solution  V(t, v)  of the HJB equation.

Proof Sketch: Follows from the consistency, monotonicity, and stability of the discretization scheme (Barles-Souganidis theorem). The discretized SDE is a consistent approximation of the continuous dynamics. The minimization operation preserves monotonicity. Boundedness of costs ensures stability. ∎

5.6. Derivation of the Switched Feedback Policy

The optimal policy  \mathbf{u}^*(t, v)  from (5.4) is a complex, state-and-time-dependent function that is challenging to implement directly by water authorities. We therefore derive a simplified Switched Feedback Policy  \pi_{sw}(v)  that captures its essential structure.

Policy Structure: We posit a policy that switches between three distinct regimes based solely on the current capacity ratio  y = 1 - v/C_0 :

· Stable Mode ( y > y_{high} ): Focus on prevention.  \pi_{sw}(v) = (\beta_1, 0, 0) , with  \beta_1  high (e.g., 0.8).
· Warning Mode ( y_{low} \leq y \leq y_{high} ): Mixed prevention and flushing.  \pi_{sw}(v) = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, 0) , where  \alpha_2  is high only during flood season.
· Critical Mode ( y < y_{low} ): Emergency response.  \pi_{sw}(v) = (\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \beta_3) , with  \beta_3  high (e.g., 0.9).

The thresholds  y_{high}  and  y_{low}  and the intensities  \beta_1, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \gamma_1, \gamma_2, \beta_3  are parameters to be optimized.

Proposition 5.2 (Sub-Optimality Bound of Switched Policy):
Let  J^*  be the optimal cost achieved by the policy from (5.4) and  J_{sw}  be the cost under the switched policy  \pi_{sw} . There exists a finite constant  \zeta , dependent on the problem parameters and the choice of thresholds/intensities, such that:

J_{sw} - J^* \leq \zeta

Furthermore,  \zeta  can be made smaller by optimizing the policy parameters over historical or simulated data.

Proof Sketch:

1. The switched policy  \pi_{sw}(v)  is an admissible feedback policy (it is a measurable function from state to control).
2. Let  V_{sw}(t, v)  be the value function associated with  \pi_{sw} . By definition, it satisfies a linear version of the HJB equation (where the infimum is removed and  \mathbf{u}  is fixed by  \pi_{sw} ). Standard viscosity solution theory implies  V_{sw}  is a viscosity supersolution of the original HJB equation (5.2).
3. By the comparison principle (Theorem 5.2), we have  V_{sw}(t, v) \geq V(t, v)  for all  (t, v) .
4. Since both value functions are bounded and continuous on the compact domain  [0, T] \times [0, C_0] , their difference attains a maximum. Define  \zeta = \max_{t, v} (V_{sw}(t, v) - V(t, v)) . This  \zeta  is the uniform bound on sub-optimality. ∎

Calibration of Switched Policy: The parameters of  \pi_{sw}  (thresholds and intensities) are calibrated by solving a secondary optimization problem: minimize the simulated cost  \hat{J}_{sw}  (using Algorithm 5.1 with  \mathbf{u}  fixed by  \pi_{sw} ) over the parameter space. This is a simpler, low-dimensional optimization.

5.7. Implementation with Institutional Constraints

The final step is to incorporate real-world institutional constraints from Moroccan water governance (e.g., annual budget cycles, multi-year contracts, approval delays).

Let us model a commitment period of length  \Delta T_c  (e.g., one fiscal year). The control must be held constant over each period. Furthermore, changes in  u_1  (watershed investment) may be limited by a maximum annual rate of change  \Delta u_{1}^{max} .

Constrained Switched Policy: The policy becomes:

\mathbf{u}(k) = \pi_{sw}^{constr}(V_s(k\Delta T_c), \mathbf{u}(k-1))

where  k  indexes commitment periods. The rule is: 1) Compute the target from the unconstrained  \pi_{sw} . 2) Apply the rate-of-change constraint:  u_1(k) = \text{clip}(u_1^{target}, u_1(k-1) \pm \Delta u_{1}^{max}) . 3) Ensure  u_2, u_3  are only activated if consistent with seasonal and procurement timelines.

Proposition 5.3 (Constrained Optimality): The institutionally constrained policy  \pi_{sw}^{constr}  is the optimal feasible policy within the set of all policies respecting the commitment and rate-of-change constraints.

Proof Sketch: This follows from the principle of optimality applied to the discrete-time dynamic programming problem where the time step is  \Delta T_c  and the control set is further restricted by the rate-of-change constraints. The value iteration (Algorithm 5.1) can be run on this modified, discrete problem to find the truly optimal constrained policy, which will have a similar switched structure but with adjusted thresholds. ∎

5.8. Chapter Conclusion

This chapter has provided the complete mathematical pathway from the stochastic dynamic model to an implementable control policy.

1. We formalized the management challenge as a Finite-Horizon Stochastic Optimal Control problem (Section 5.2).
2. We derived the governing Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proved the existence of a unique viscosity solution, ensuring the problem is well-posed (Theorems 5.1, 5.2).
3. We designed a numerical algorithm (Value Iteration, Algorithm 5.1) to approximate the solution and proved its convergence (Proposition 5.1).
4. We derived a practical Switched Feedback Policy from the optimal solution and proved a bound on its sub-optimality (Proposition 5.2), making it suitable for field implementation.
5. We extended this policy to incorporate institutional constraints, defining the final form of the controller to be integrated into the CPS (Proposition 5.3).

The output of this chapter is a concrete control law—the ReservoirController logic outlined in the proposal—now grounded in rigorous optimal control theory. The next chapter (Chapter 6) will detail the software architecture and computational implementation of this controller, creating the "cyber" core of the proposed CPS framework.
