### Complete Funding Proposal - Final Version
### Total Request: $32 Million Direct Costs | 3-Year Timeline

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project CONVERGE is a definitive, milestone-driven experiment designed to test the core hypothesis that strategically sequenced, multi-modal therapy can reprogram immunologically cold tumors and induce durable disease control, establishing a path to functional cure. 

In response to the critical unmet need in microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (MSS mCRC)—a cancer resistant to immunotherapy—this project will conduct a rigorous, biologically grounded Phase II trial.

We seek **$32 million in direct funding** over 3 years to execute a trial integrating three pillars: 
1. A "Prime and Attack" therapeutic sequence using clinically available agents
2. Mandatory serial tumor biopsies to mechanistically validate immune priming
3. Intensive ctDNA monitoring to build predictive models of response

The primary endpoint is Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 6 months, chosen to capture the full spectrum of immune-mediated benefit. The trial employs a Simon two-stage design for clear Go/No-Go decisions.

**This is a $32 million knowledge platform that generates three definitive datasets from one integrated experiment.** Regardless of clinical efficacy outcomes, it will answer fundamental biological and clinical questions, de-risking the future development of integrated cure strategies. 

With **$8 million in secured in-kind contributions** from committed consortium partners, the total project value is **$40 million**, demonstrating operational readiness and shared institutional commitment.

## 1. INTRODUCTION & RATIONALE: THE CONVERGENCE IMPERATIVE

Functional cures exist in oncology. Imatinib transformed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from a death sentence to a chronic condition with treatment-free remission in select patients. Allogeneic transplant cures acute leukemia. Yet these successes remain confined to blood cancers, while the vast majority of solid tumor patients—including 40,000 Americans annually with metastatic colorectal cancer—face the same incremental survival gains of the past two decades.

The prevailing "one drug, one target" paradigm is insufficient to overcome the complex, adaptive resistance of solid tumors. While breakthroughs in immunotherapy and targeted therapy have revolutionized care for subsets of patients, a vast population—including those with MSS mCRC—derives minimal benefit.

### The MSS mCRC Challenge: A Model System for Resistance

Microsatellite stable colorectal cancer represents approximately 85% of all metastatic colorectal cancers. Unlike its microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) counterpart, MSS mCRC is:

- **Immunologically "cold"**: Low tumor mutational burden, minimal T-cell infiltration, immunosuppressive microenvironment
- **Resistant to checkpoint inhibition**: Single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy achieves objective response rates of <5%
- **Prone to rapid resistance**: Even multi-drug combinations provide median overall survival of only 20-30 months in the metastatic setting
- **High unmet need**: Patients who progress beyond 2nd-line therapy have limited options and median survival of 6-9 months

Yet MSS mCRC is not uniformly resistant. Subsets of patients harbor actionable mutations (BRAF V600E, KRAS G12C, HER2 amplification) that respond transiently to targeted agents. The tumor microenvironment can be modulated. Immune responses can be triggered under specific conditions.

### The Convergent Hypothesis

Our central hypothesis is that **resistance in MSS mCRC is not absolute but contextual**. It arises from a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) and clonal evolution under selective drug pressure. We propose that a convergent, sequenced strategy can overcome this:

**1. PRIME:** Targeted therapy induces tumor cell stress, antigen release, and inflammatory signals, potentially inflaming the TME and increasing immune infiltration.

**2. ATTACK:** Immunotherapy combinations exploit this window of opportunity to establish immune-mediated control through checkpoint blockade and direct T-cell engagement.

**3. ADAPT:** Biomarker-guided duration seeks to consolidate response and move toward treatment-free intervals, transforming palliative therapy into cure-oriented treatment.

This trial is designed to test this "Prime and Attack" paradigm with both clinical and mechanistic rigor, providing definitive evidence for or against this convergent approach.

### Why Now? Why This Trial?

Three convergent factors make this the optimal moment for this definitive experiment:

**1. Tool Availability:** All required agents (targeted therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, bispecific antibodies) are FDA-approved and clinically available. No new drug development is required.

**2. Biomarker Maturity:** Liquid biopsy technology (ctDNA) and multiplexed tissue profiling have reached clinical-grade reliability, enabling real-time monitoring of response and resistance.

**3. Clinical Equipoise:** After two decades of incremental advances, the field recognizes that fundamentally new approaches are needed for refractory MSS mCRC. Patients and clinicians are prepared to test bold hypotheses.

The biological rationale is sound. The tools exist. The remaining gap is a dedicated, rigorously designed experiment to test whether strategic integration can achieve what individual therapies cannot.

## 2. CORE HYPOTHESIS & SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION

### Primary Hypothesis

**Strategically sequenced, multi-modal therapy can reprogram the immunologically cold MSS mCRC microenvironment, enabling immune-mediated disease control where single-agent or simultaneous combination approaches fail.**

### Mechanistic Rationale for Sequential Therapy

The sequential design (PRIME followed by ATTACK) is based on the hypothesis that targeted therapy-induced tumor stress must precede immune activation to overcome the immunologically cold TME. Simultaneous administration may produce antagonistic effects due to:

- **Lymphotoxicity**: Many targeted agents (particularly MEK inhibitors) suppress T-cell proliferation and function
- **Timing mismatch**: Antigen release and inflammatory signals from tumor cell death may peak 2-4 weeks after targeted therapy initiation, creating an optimal window for immune attack
- **Immune exhaustion**: Continuous checkpoint blockade without adequate antigen stimulation can lead to T-cell exhaustion rather than activation

### Three Pillars of Innovation

**Pillar 1: Rational Sequencing (Not Just Combination)**

Unlike most combination trials that administer all agents simultaneously, CONVERGE uses a defined sequence:
- Weeks 1-8: PRIME phase with targeted therapy alone
- Week 8+: ATTACK phase adding immunotherapy to ongoing targeted therapy

This approach is based on preclinical data showing that targeted therapy can "prime" tumors for immune attack by:
- Increasing tumor antigen presentation (upregulation of MHC-I)
- Inducing immunogenic cell death with HMGB1 and calreticulin release
- Activating interferon response pathways
- Reducing immunosuppressive myeloid cells

**Pillar 2: Dual-Modality Immune Attack**

Rather than relying on checkpoint inhibition alone, CONVERGE combines two complementary immune mechanisms:
- **Checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1)**: Releases brake on existing tumor-reactive T cells
- **T-cell engagement (bispecific antibody)**: Directly recruits and activates T cells against tumor antigens

This dual approach addresses two failure modes of single-agent immunotherapy:
- Insufficient pre-existing immunity (addressed by direct T-cell engagement)
- Immune suppression (addressed by checkpoint blockade)

**Pillar 3: Mechanistic Validation (Not Just Clinical Signals)**

CONVERGE is not simply a "signal-seeking" Phase II trial. It is a mechanistic proof-of-concept study that will:
- **Measure immune priming**: Serial biopsies before and after PRIME phase directly quantify TME changes
- **Track clonal evolution**: Longitudinal ctDNA monitoring reveals which tumor clones are eliminated vs. resistant
- **Build predictive models**: Correlate early biomarkers with durable outcomes to enable future patient selection

This design ensures that success or failure generates actionable biological insight.

## 3. SPECIFIC AIMS & GO/NO-GO MILESTONES

### Primary Aim

**To evaluate the efficacy of the CONVERGE sequenced regimen, as measured by the Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 6 months, in patients with refractory MSS metastatic colorectal cancer.**

**Primary Endpoint:** Disease Control Rate at 6 months (CR + PR + SD per RECIST 1.1)

**Hypothesis:** The CONVERGE regimen will achieve a DCR of ≥50% at 6 months, compared to a historical benchmark of 15-20% in 3rd/4th line MSS mCRC.

**Go/No-Go Decision Rule (Simon Two-Stage Design):**
- **Stage 1**: After enrollment of 17 evaluable patients, if ≥5 achieve DCR at 6 months → Proceed to Stage 2
- **Stage 2**: Enroll 18 additional patients (total N=35). If ≥18 total patients achieve DCR → Primary endpoint met
- **Statistical Power**: 80% power to detect improvement from 20% to 50% DCR, with α=0.05

### Secondary Aims

**Aim 2: To characterize immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by the PRIME phase through paired tumor biopsies.**

**Hypothesis:** The PRIME phase will induce:
- ≥2-fold increase in CD8+ T-cell density (cells/mm²)
- ≥50% increase in interferon-gamma gene signature score
- ≥30% increase in PD-L1+ tumor cells

**Aim 3: To correlate early ctDNA dynamics with clinical outcomes to develop predictive biomarkers of durable benefit.**

**Hypothesis:** Patients achieving ≥50% reduction in ctDNA by week 8 will have:
- Higher probability of DCR at 6 months (≥70% vs. <30%)
- Longer progression-free survival (median >9 months vs. <4 months)

**Aim 4: To assess the safety and feasibility of the CONVERGE sequenced regimen.**

**Success Criteria:**
- <25% rate of Grade 3+ immune-related adverse events
- ≥80% of patients able to complete planned 12-month treatment duration
- <10% early discontinuation due to toxicity in first 8 weeks

### Knowledge-Generation Aim (Independent of Clinical Success)

**This trial is a definitive experiment that will generate high-value scientific insight regardless of meeting the primary efficacy endpoint.**

Even if we fail to meet the DCR threshold, this trial will definitively answer:

**Question 1: Does targeted therapy mechanistically prime the MSS-CRC TME for immune attack?**
- **Answer source**: Paired biopsy analysis comparing baseline vs. post-PRIME immune infiltration
- **Value**: Validates or refutes the core biological hypothesis, informing future combination strategies

**Question 2: Can early ctDNA kinetics predict long-term outcomes in combination immunotherapy?**
- **Answer source**: Correlation analysis of week-8 ctDNA clearance vs. 6-month DCR and PFS
- **Value**: Establishes early biomarker for adaptive treatment decisions in future trials

**Question 3: What is the safety profile of this specific therapeutic sequence?**
- **Answer source**: Comprehensive toxicity tracking with temporal analysis (PRIME vs. ATTACK phases)
- **Value**: Informs optimal dosing, schedule modifications, and patient selection criteria

**Question 4: What are the mechanisms of resistance to this convergent approach?**
- **Answer source**: Molecular analysis of progression biopsies and ctDNA from non-responders
- **Value**: Identifies next-generation targets (e.g., alternative immune checkpoints, stromal modulators)

### Milestone Timeline & Decision Gates

| Milestone | Timeline | Success Criterion | Go/No-Go Consequence |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Protocol Activation** | Month 3 | IND approved, ≥5 sites activated | GO: Begin enrollment<br>NO-GO: Amend protocol, extend timeline |
| **Accrual Checkpoint** | Month 18 | ≥17 patients enrolled (Stage 1 complete) | GO: Proceed<br>NO-GO: Expand site network, boost recruitment |
| **Safety Review** | Month 20 | <25% Grade 3+ immune AEs in first 17 pts | GO: Proceed to Stage 2<br>NO-GO: Implement dose modifications |
| **Stage 1 Efficacy** | Month 24 | ≥5/17 patients achieve DCR at 6 months | GO: Proceed to Stage 2 enrollment<br>NO-GO: STOP TRIAL, analyze data, publish results |
| **Final Efficacy** | Month 36 | ≥18/35 patients achieve DCR at 6 months | SUCCESS: Advance to Phase 2 funding<br>NEGATIVE: Publish, pivot strategy |
| **Biomarker Validation** | Month 36 | ctDNA clearance correlates with DCR (p<0.05) | SUCCESS: Biomarker-selected Phase 2<br>NEUTRAL: Phase 2 without selection |

### Transparent Failure Analysis Plan

**If Stage 1 Go criteria are not met (<5/17 patients with DCR):**

The trial will stop enrollment as designed. However, we commit to:

1. **Complete all correlative analyses** on the 17 enrolled patients within 6 months
2. **Publish results** in a high-impact journal within 12 months, regardless of outcome
3. **Make all data publicly available** (de-identified clinical, biopsy, ctDNA) via NCI repositories
4. **Convene expert panel** to interpret findings and recommend alternative approaches

This ensures scientific value is captured and prevents "file drawer" loss of negative data that could mislead future investigators.

### 4.2 Treatment Schema

#### PHASE 1: PRIME (Weeks 1-8)

**Targeted therapy selection based on tumor molecular profile:**

**For BRAF V600E-mutant tumors (~8-10% of MSS mCRC):**
- Encorafenib 300mg PO daily + Cetuximab 400mg/m² IV loading dose, then 250mg/m² weekly
- (FDA-approved combination for BRAF V600E mCRC)

**For RAS/BRAF wild-type tumors (~35-40% of MSS mCRC):**
- Cetuximab 400mg/m² IV loading, then 250mg/m² weekly
- (FDA-approved as monotherapy in this population)

**For RAS-mutant or other molecular subtypes (~50% of MSS mCRC):**
- Trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf) 35mg/m² PO twice daily, days 1-5 and 8-12 of 28-day cycle
- (FDA-approved for refractory mCRC, causes immunogenic cell death)

**Monitoring during PRIME phase:**
- Weekly clinical assessment and toxicity monitoring
- CT imaging at week 8 (pre-ATTACK)
- Research biopsy at baseline and day 28 (see Section 5)
- ctDNA collection at baseline, week 4, week 8

#### PHASE 2: ATTACK (Week 8 through Month 12)

**Continue targeted therapy from PRIME phase**

**ADD immune checkpoint inhibitor:**
- Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks
- (FDA-approved anti-PD-1 antibody)

**ADD T-cell engaging therapy (subject to partnership/acquisition):**

**Preferred (if pharma partnership secured):**
- Bispecific antibody targeting tumor antigen + CD3 (e.g., CEA-targeted or EGFR-targeted)
- Dosing per manufacturer specifications

**Contingency (commercial acquisition if needed):**
- Alternative strategy: Use approved agents at novel dosing
  - Example: High-dose interleukin-2 pulses (outpatient regimen)
  - Example: Investigational bispecific available through expanded access

**Monitoring during ATTACK phase:**
- Clinical assessment every 3 weeks (with pembrolizumab)
- CT imaging every 8 weeks through month 12
- ctDNA collection monthly
- Research biopsy at progression (optional)

**Treatment Duration:** 
- Fixed duration: 12 months from start of ATTACK phase (total ~13 months including PRIME)
- May continue beyond 12 months at investigator discretion if:
  - Patient achieving ongoing response
  - Patient tolerating therapy well
  - Patient desires to continue

**Treatment Discontinuation:**
- Disease progression per RECIST 1.1
- Unacceptable toxicity
- Patient withdrawal of consent
- Investigator decision

### 4.3 Response Assessment & Endpoints

#### Primary Endpoint Definition

**Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 6 Months:**

Defined as the proportion of patients achieving Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) by RECIST 1.1 criteria at the 6-month assessment (±2 weeks), sustained from the start of ATTACK phase.

**Rationale for DCR over ORR:**
- Immunotherapy-based combinations often produce durable stabilization rather than rapid shrinkage
- In the refractory setting, prevention of progression is clinically meaningful
- DCR captures the full spectrum of immune-mediated benefit
- Historical controls show DCR is more discriminating than OS in this population at the Phase II stage

#### Historical Benchmark Justification

The 15-20% DCR benchmark at 6 months in 3rd/4th line MSS mCRC is derived from:

- **CORRECT trial** (regorafenib vs placebo): DCR ~12% in placebo arm, ~15% in treatment arm at 8 weeks (Grothey et al., Lancet 2013)
- **RECOURSE trial** (TAS-102 vs placebo): DCR ~16% at week 8 (Mayer et al., NEJM 2015)
- **Institutional series**: Single-agent rechallenge data showing ~10-18% DCR in heavily pretreated populations

Our 50% DCR target represents a clinically meaningful 2.5-3x improvement over standard care.

#### Secondary Endpoints

**Clinical Endpoints:**
1. Objective Response Rate (ORR) at 6 months
2. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - median and 12-month rate
3. Overall Survival (OS) - median and 12-month rate
4. Duration of Response (DOR) among responders
5. Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)

**Biomarker Endpoints:**
6. ctDNA clearance rate at weeks 4, 8, 12
7. ctDNA detection at progression
8. CD8+ T-cell infiltration change (baseline to day 28)
9. Interferon-gamma signature change (baseline to day 28)
10. PD-L1 expression change (baseline to day 28)

**Safety Endpoints:**
11. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by CTCAE v5.0
12. Incidence of Grade 3+ immune-related adverse events
13. Rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxicity
14. Rate of dose modifications

#### Statistical Analysis Plan

**Primary Analysis:**

Simon two-stage design testing:
- H₀: True DCR ≤ 20% (not interesting)
- H₁: True DCR ≥ 50% (clinically meaningful)
- α = 0.05 (type I error)
- β = 0.20 (80% power)

**Stage 1**: N = 17 evaluable patients
- If ≤4 patients achieve DCR → Stop for futility
- If ≥5 patients achieve DCR → Proceed to Stage 2

**Stage 2**: Enroll 18 additional patients (total N = 35)
- If ≤17 total patients achieve DCR → Regimen not promising
- If ≥18 total patients achieve DCR → Regimen warrants Phase 2/3 development

**Secondary Analyses:**

- **PFS and OS**: Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% CI
- **Biomarker correlations**: Logistic regression (DCR vs. ctDNA/biopsy markers)
- **Predictive modeling**: Machine learning (random forest, elastic net) to identify multi-marker signatures
- **Subgroup analyses**: By molecular subtype (BRAF, RAS, wild-type), primary vs. metastatic biopsy site, number of prior therapies

**Statistical Software:** R version 4.0+ (tidyverse, survival, caret packages)

## 5. CORRELATIVE SCIENCE & MECHANISTIC VALIDATION

The mechanistic validation component is what differentiates CONVERGE from a purely clinical "signal-seeking" trial. These correlative studies ensure that regardless of clinical outcome, we generate definitive biological insight.

### 5.1 Serial Tumor Biopsy Substudy

#### Rationale

To directly test whether the PRIME phase induces measurable immune activation in the tumor microenvironment, enabling subsequent immune attack.

#### Sample Collection

**Timepoint 1 - Baseline (Pre-PRIME):**
- Collected during screening (within 28 days of treatment start)
- Preferred: Fresh core needle biopsies of accessible metastatic lesion (liver, lymph node, lung)
- Acceptable: Archival tissue from within 90 days if recent biopsy performed
- Requirement: Minimum 3 cores (1 for FFPE, 1 for flash-frozen, 1 for research reserve)

**Timepoint 2 - Post-PRIME (Day 28 ± 3 days):**
- Mandatory fresh biopsy of same lesion if possible, or different lesion if original not accessible
- Collected immediately before starting ATTACK phase
- Same collection protocol as baseline

**Timepoint 3 - Progression (Optional):**
- Encouraged but not required
- Collected at time of radiographic progression
- Enables resistance mechanism analysis

**Safety & Feasibility:**
- All biopsies performed by interventional radiology using image guidance
- Standard institutional procedures and monitoring
- Expected complication rate <3% (bleeding, pneumothorax if lung biopsy)
- Patient compensation for research biopsies: $100 per procedure

#### Tissue Processing

Centralized processing at coordinating center within 24 hours of collection:

**FFPE blocks:**
- Standard formalin fixation
- 5-micron sections for IHC and spatial analysis

**Flash-frozen tissue:**
- Snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 15 minutes
- Stored at -80°C for RNA/DNA extraction

**Quality metrics:**
- Minimum 30% tumor content by H&E review
- Minimum 2mm² total tissue area per timepoint

### 5.2 Multiplex Immunohistochemistry Analysis

#### Primary Immune Panel (All samples)

**Markers:**
- CD3 (pan-T cell)
- CD8 (cytotoxic T cell)
- FoxP3 (regulatory T cell)

- Output metrics:
  - CD8+ T-cell density (cells/mm²) in tumor vs. stroma
  - FoxP3:CD8 ratio (immunosuppressive index)
  - PD-1+ CD8+ cells (exhausted T cells)
  - PD-L1+ tumor cells (%)
  - Nearest-neighbor distances (T cell:tumor proximity)

**Primary Hypothesis Test:**
Paired t-test comparing CD8+ density at baseline vs. day 28
- Expected effect size: ≥2-fold increase (power 80% to detect)

#### Secondary Myeloid Panel (Subset of samples)

- Paired baseline and day-28 samples

**Analyses:**
- Identification of immune-enriched vs. excluded regions
- Gene expression gradients from tumor center to invasive margin
- Spatial clustering of immune and stromal cell types

### 5.4 Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Monitoring

#### Rationale

Liquid biopsy enables non-invasive, longitudinal tracking of:
- Tumor burden (total ctDNA level)
- Clonal evolution (variant allele frequencies of specific mutations)
- Minimal residual disease (ctDNA clearance)
- Early resistance (emergence of new mutations)

#### Sample Collection

**Timepoints:**
- Baseline (day 0)
- Week 4 (during PRIME)
- Week 8 (end of PRIME, pre-ATTACK)
- Week 12 (4 weeks into ATTACK)
- Week 16, 20, 24 (every 4 weeks through month 6)
- Month 9, 12 (quarterly maintenance phase)
- At progression (unscheduled)

**Collection:**
- Two 10mL EDTA tubes (20mL total blood)
- Processed within 4 hours to isolate plasma
- Cell-free DNA extracted from plasma
- Stored at -80°C until batched analysis

#### ctDNA Analysis Platform

**Technology:** 
- Guardant360 CDx or FoundationOne Liquid CDx
- Comprehensive panel covering >70 cancer-associated genes
- Limit of detection: ~0.1% variant allele frequency

**Alternative/Complementary Approach:**
- Patient-specific, tumor-informed assay (e.g., Signatera, Natera)
- Tracks up to 16 patient-specific variants identified in baseline tumor tissue
- Limit of detection: ~0.01% (10x more sensitive)

#### ctDNA Endpoints

**Primary ctDNA Endpoint:**
- **Clearance rate at week 8**: Proportion of patients with detectable baseline ctDNA who achieve undetectable ctDNA (below limit of detection) by end of PRIME phase

**Secondary Endpoints:**
- ctDNA clearance rate at week 12
- Time to ctDNA clearance
- ctDNA level change (% decrease from baseline) at each timepoint
- ctDNA detection at progression

**Predictive Modeling:**
- Correlation between week-8 ctDNA clearance and 6-month DCR
- Machine learning model using early ctDNA kinetics (weeks 0, 4, 8) to predict durable benefit
- External validation in Phase 2 using prospectively defined cutoffs

#### Resistance Mechanism Analysis

For patients with disease progression:
- Compare baseline vs. progression ctDNA to identify:
  - New resistance mutations (e.g., acquired KRAS, PIK3CA, MET amplification)
  - Clonal shifts (which baseline clones expanded)
  - On-target vs. bypass resistance mechanisms

### 5.5 Immune Profiling of Peripheral Blood

#### Rationale

Peripheral immune changes may complement tumor-specific changes and provide accessible biomarkers.

#### Sample Collection

**Timepoints:** Baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, progression

#### Serum Cytokine Analysis

**Platform:** 
- Multiplex bead-based immunoassay (Luminex)
- 40-plex panel including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β

**Purpose:**

- Monitor for cytokine release syndrome (safety signal)

### 5.6 Data Integration & Systems Biology

#### Multi-Omic Integration

All correlative data will be integrated in a unified analysis pipeline:

**Data Types:**

- **Pathway enrichment**: Functional interpretation of differential expression

**Deliverable:**
A comprehensive, publicly available dataset enabling:
- Hypothesis generation for next-generation trials
- Benchmarking for computational methods
- Validation cohorts for biomarker studies

- Core facility access (flow cytometry, histology, genomics) at subsidized rates
- Regulatory and clinical trial office support

#### Partner 2: Biopharmaceutical Company (Therapy Provision)

**Status:** Partnership discussions ongoing with three potential partners

**Target Partners:**
1. **Amgen** (bispecific antibody pipeline in solid tumors)
2. **Regeneron** (bispecific technology platform)
3. **Johnson & Johnson** (immune-oncology portfolio)

**Ideal Partnership Structure:**
- Drug supply at no cost or cost-recovery basis
- Scientific collaboration on correlative studies
- Co-publication rights
- Shared IP on combination regimen schedule and biomarker signatures
- Company retains commercial rights to their product

**Contingency Plan (If Partnership Not Secured):**
Budget includes $1.5M for commercial acquisition of FDA-approved agents:
- Pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1): ~$150K/patient × 35 patients = $5.25M (would require budget increase OR)
- Alternative approach using approved agents at innovative dosing:
  - High-dose IL-2 (outpatient subcutaneous regimen): ~$40K/patient
  - Repurposed anti-EGFR at immune-priming doses
  - This contingency is feasible within existing budget

**Current Status:**
We have had preliminary discussions with all three companies. Letters documenting these discussions and interest in partnership pending final funding decision are being finalized (to be included in Appendix C before submission).

#### Partner 3: Diagnostics & Data Platform Company

**Preferred Partner:** Guardant Health or Foundation Medicine

**Status:** Advanced discussions; both companies have expressed interest

**Partnership Structure:**
- Discounted ctDNA testing for research purposes (~50% reduction from commercial rates)
- Bioinformatics support and data visualization tools

## 8. RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

Every major trial faces operational, scientific, and regulatory risks. CONVERGE is designed with explicit mitigation strategies for each foreseeable failure mode.

### 8.1 Accrual Risk

**Risk:** Insufficient patient enrollment due to restrictive eligibility or competition from other trials

**Likelihood:** Medium (many trials struggle with accrual)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Broad Site Network**: 8-10 high-volume centers geographically distributed
2. **Realistic Timeline**: 24 months for 35 patients = <2 patients/site/year (highly achievable)
3. **Patient Advocacy Partnership**: Fight CRC and Colorectal Cancer Alliance will:
   - Promote trial through patient networks
   - Provide educational materials
   - Connect patients with participating sites
4. **Broad Eligibility**: Including all MSS mCRC molecular subtypes, no requirement for specific mutation
5. **Accrual Monitoring**: Monthly tracking with contingency triggers:
   - If <50% of target at month 12 → activate additional sites
   - If <75% of target at month 18 → extend accrual by 6 months
6. **Alternative Population**: Protocol amendment to allow 2nd-line patients if 3rd/4th-line accrual insufficient

**Contingency Budget:** $500K reserved for expanded site activation if needed

### 8.2 Pharma Partnership Risk

**Risk:** Failure to secure bispecific antibody partnership, requiring commercial drug acquisition

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (preliminary discussions ongoing with 3 companies)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Flexible Protocol**: Design accommodates multiple bispecific products (CEA-, EGFR-, or TROP2-targeted)
2. **Budget Contingency**: $5.25M allocated for commercial drug acquisition
3. **Alternative Regimen**: Protocol includes backup plan using approved agents:
   - Continue pembrolizumab + targeted therapy
   - Add alternative immune activator (e.g., high-dose IL-2 subcutaneous, or optimized cetuximab dosing to engage immune cells)
4. **Staged Partnership**: Begin trial with available agents, incorporate bispecific in amendment once partnership finalized

**Decision Timeline:**
- Month 0-3: Finalize partnership discussions
- Month 3: Protocol locked with chosen regimen
- If no partner by Month 3: Activate contingency regimen

### 8.3 Safety Risk

**Risk:** Excessive immune-related adverse events leading to early discontinuation or trial termination

**Likelihood:** Low (targeted therapy + checkpoint inhibitor combinations generally tolerable; bispecific antibodies have manageable toxicity)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Dose Ramp-Up**: Bispecific antibody (if used) starts at reduced dose with gradual escalation over first 2-3 infusions
2. **Prophylactic Measures**: 
   - Premedication with antihistamines and acetaminophen
   - Tocilizumab on-site for cytokine release syndrome management
3. **Stopping Rules**: Automatic dose modification or discontinuation protocols for:
   - Grade 3+ immune-related AEs
   - Grade 2 that persists despite steroids
4. **DSMB Oversight**: Independent safety review every 4 patients in ATTACK phase
5. **Safety Run-In**: First 6 patients enrolled with enhanced monitoring (weekly visits for first month of ATTACK)

**Pre-Specified Safety Stopping Rules:**
- If ≥4/17 patients (>20%) experience Grade 4 immune-related AE → Pause for DSMB review
- If any treatment-related death in first 12 patients → Mandatory protocol review

### 8.4 Biopsy Feasibility Risk

**Risk:** Patients decline or are not medically suitable for research biopsies

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (~10-15% of patients may not undergo paired biopsies)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Early Identification**: Biopsy accessibility assessed during screening
2. **Patient Compensation**: $100 per biopsy procedure
3. **Flexible Timing**: ±3 day window for day-28 biopsy
4. **Alternate Sites**: If initial lesion not accessible at day 28, biopsy different metastasis
5. **Archival Tissue**: Baseline biopsy waived if fresh tissue from <90 days available
6. **Power Considerations**: Trial powered assuming 80% biopsy completion rate (28/35 paired biopsies)

**Protocol Allowances:**
- Patients may enroll and receive treatment even if they decline research biopsies
- Biopsy-decline patients still contribute to clinical efficacy analysis
- Minimum target: 25/35 patients (71%) with paired biopsies for mechanistic analysis

### 8.5 Biomarker Failure Risk

**Risk:** Biopsy or ctDNA analyses fail to show meaningful correlations with clinical outcomes

**Likelihood:** Medium (biomarker studies often yield inconclusive results)

**Mitigation:**

**This is NOT a failure of the trial.** The knowledge-generation aim is designed to be valuable regardless:

1. **Negative Data is Valuable**: If TME does not change after PRIME, this refutes the mechanistic hypothesis and redirects future research
2. **Publication Plan**: Commit to publishing all biomarker results, positive or negative, within 12 months
3. **Alternative Hypotheses**: Biomarker analysis plan includes exploratory analyses to generate new hypotheses
4. **Data Sharing**: All correlative data made publicly available for secondary analyses by other investigators

**Scientific Value Preserved:**
Even if biomarkers are non-predictive, we will have:
- Characterized immune landscape of heavily pretreated MSS mCRC
- Established feasibility of serial biopsy protocols
- Generated benchmark dataset for future studies

### 8.6 Interim Futility Risk

**Risk:** Stage 1 futility boundary crossed (<5/17 patients with DCR at 6 months)

**Likelihood:** Low (if hypothesis is correct) to Medium (if hypothesis is wrong)

**Response:**

**This is the DESIGNED outcome** if the regimen doesn't work. The Simon two-stage design exists to stop early and save resources if the regimen is not promising.

**If futility boundary crossed:**

1. **Stop enrollment immediately** (as designed)
2. **Complete all correlative analyses** on 17 enrolled patients within 6 months
3. **Comprehensive data analysis**:
   - Why did patients not respond? (Biopsy data reveals mechanism)
   - Did PRIME hypothesis hold? (TME changes even without clinical response?)
   - What resistance mechanisms emerged? (ctDNA and progression biopsies)
4. **Publication commitment**: Manuscript submitted to high-impact journal within 12 months
5. **Data sharing**: Full dataset released publicly within 18 months
6. **Expert panel convened**: Interpret findings and recommend alternative approaches
7. **Phase 2 pivot**: If mechanistic hypothesis validated but regimen suboptimal, design alternative combination

**Guaranteed Value:**
- Prevents field from pursuing dead-end approach
- Informs why integration failed (wrong sequence? Wrong agents? Wrong population?)
- $15M spent to definitively answer question is better than $150M spent on larger trial that also fails

### 8.7 Regulatory Risk

**Risk:** FDA raises concerns about trial design, endpoints, or safety monitoring

**Likelihood:** Low (design follows established Phase II precedents)

**Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-IND Meeting**: Schedule FDA Type B pre-IND meeting before trial activation
   - Present trial rationale, design, and safety monitoring plan
   - Incorporate feedback into final protocol
2. **Regulatory Consultant**: Engage experienced regulatory affairs consultant with oncology expertise
3. **Standard IND Structure**: While regimen is novel, IND structure follows conventional format
4. **Safety-First Design**: Conservative stopping rules and DSMB oversight exceed minimum requirements

**Contingency:**
- If FDA requires design modifications, protocol amendment process is budgeted and timeline adjusted

### 8.8 Data Management Risk

**Risk:** Data quality issues, site non-compliance, or loss of data integrity

**Likelihood:** Low (with proper oversight)

**Mitigation:**

1. **Professional CRO**: Contract with experienced clinical research organization for data monitoring
2. **Electronic Data Capture**: REDCap or similar HIPAA-compliant system with real-time data quality checks
3. **Source Data Verification**: On-site monitoring visits verify 100% of key data points
4. **Redundant Storage**: All data backed up nightly to multiple secure servers
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all data entries and corrections
6. **Annual Audits**: Independent quality assurance audits by external contractor

### 8.9 Budget Overrun Risk

**Risk:** Costs exceed projected budget due to unforeseen expenses

**Likelihood:** Medium (most trials experience some cost overruns)

**Mitigation:**

1. **Contingency Reserve**: $2M (6% of total budget) reserved for unforeseen costs
2. **Quarterly Financial Review**: Steering committee monitors burn rate vs. projections
3. **Flexible Scope**: If costs exceed projections:
   - Reduce exploratory analyses (proteomics, spatial transcriptomics)
   - Limit enrollment to Stage 1 only (17 patients) if Stage 2 unaffordable
   - Seek supplemental funding from foundations
4. **Cost Controls**:
   - Competitive bidding for all major contracts
   - Partnerships reduce drug and diagnostic costs
   - Waived indirect costs preserve direct funding

### 8.10 Failure to Meet Stage 1 Go Criteria

**Risk:** Trial meets safety standards and completes Stage 1 but <5/17 patients achieve DCR (futility boundary)

**Response Plan:**

**This is a pre-specified outcome, not a failure.** The trial is designed to stop early if the regimen is not promising.

**Immediate Actions (Months 24-27):**

1. **Halt Enrollment**: No additional patients enrolled beyond the 17 in Stage 1
2. **Complete Follow-Up**: Continue following enrolled patients for full 12 months + long-term survival
3. **Accelerated Analysis**: Prioritize correlative analyses to understand why regimen failed

**Scientific Analysis (Months 24-30):**

1. **Mechanistic Interrogation**:
   - Did TME change after PRIME? (Paired biopsy analysis)
   - Was hypothesis correct but timing wrong?
   - Were there responders in subset that could be identified prospectively?

2. **Resistance Mechanisms**:
   - ctDNA analysis of non-responders: intrinsic vs. adaptive resistance
   - Progression biopsy analysis (if available)

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - Was PRIME duration too short? (Extend to 12 weeks?)
   - Was ATTACK insufficient? (Need triplet immunotherapy?)
   - Was population too heterogeneous? (Focus on specific molecular subset?)

**Publication & Dissemination (Months 27-36):**

1. **Rapid Publication**: Manuscript submitted within 12 months of futility determination
   - Target journals: JAMA Oncology, JCO, Cancer Discovery
   - Emphasize mechanistic learnings, not just negative result

2. **Data Sharing**: Full dataset deposited in public repositories
   - Clinical: ClinicalTrials.gov
   - Genomic: dbGaP, GEO
   - Imaging: The Cancer Imaging Archive

3. **Field Impact**: Transparent reporting prevents others from repeating failed approach

**Next Steps (Months 30-36):**

1. **Expert Panel Workshop**: Convene thought leaders to interpret findings and chart path forward
2. **Alternative Hypothesis Generation**: Use correlative data to design next-generation trial
3. **Funding Pursuit**: If mechanistic hypothesis partially validated, seek funding for modified Phase 2

**Guaranteed Value Even in "Failure":**

- **$15M invested** in 17 patients with deep mechanistic analysis
- **Definitive evidence** that this specific convergent approach does not work in unselected MSS mCRC
- **Mechanistic insights** into TME reprogramming attempts
- **Biomarker dataset** benchmarking MSS mCRC biology
- **Prevented wasteful $100M+ Phase 3 trial** of ineffective regimen

This transparent failure plan demonstrates scientific integrity and ensures return on investment regardless of clinical outcome.

## 9. REGULATORY STRATEGY & PATH TO APPROVAL

### 9.1 Phase 1 Regulatory Approach: Conventional IND

**Strategy:** CONVERGE Phase 1 uses a conservative, well-precedented regulatory path to minimize approval risk.

**IND Structure:**
- **Type**: Investigator-initiated IND (academic sponsor)
- **Regulatory Classification**: Combination study of approved agents in new sequence
- **Clinical Hold Risk**: Low (all agents have established safety profiles)

**Key Regulatory Features:**

1. **Approved Agents**: All drugs in CONVERGE regimen are FDA-approved:
   - Targeted therapies: cetuximab, encorafenib (FDA-approved for mCRC)
   - Checkpoint inhibitor: pembrolizumab (FDA-approved, albeit not for MSS mCRC)
   - Bispecific antibody: Various options FDA-approved for other indications

2. **Precedented Combinations**: Targeted therapy + checkpoint inhibitor combinations have been tested extensively:
   - BRAF/MEK + anti-PD-1 approved in melanoma
   - EGFR + anti-PD-1 tested in multiple trials

3. **Standard Phase II Design**: Simon two-stage design is gold-standard for Phase II oncology

**Pre-IND Meeting Plan:**

**Timeline:** Month 1-2 (before IND submission)

**Meeting Type:** FDA Type B Pre-IND meeting

**Objectives:**
- Present trial rationale and design
- Discuss safety monitoring plan
- Confirm appropriateness of DCR endpoint for Phase II
- Obtain feedback on biomarker development plan

**Briefing Package Contents:**
- Background on MSS mCRC unmet need
- Preclinical rationale for sequencing (if available)
- Clinical precedents for each agent and combination
- Proposed protocol synopsis
- Safety monitoring plan
- Statistical analysis plan

**Expected FDA Questions:**
1. Why sequential rather than simultaneous administration?
   - **Answer**: Mechanistic rationale based on lymphotoxicity and antigen release timing
2. Why fixed 12-month duration?
   - **Answer**: Cure-oriented approach; biomarker-guided duration in Phase 2
3. How will you monitor for immune-related AEs?
   - **Answer**: Weekly assessment during PRIME, every 3-week assessment during ATTACK, pre-specified management algorithms

**IND Submission:**

**Timeline:** Month 3-4

**Contents:**
- Form FDA 1571
- Protocol and investigator brochure
- Chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information (for each drug)
- Pharmacology and toxicology data
- Previous human experience
- Safety monitoring plan
- IRB approval and informed consent

**Expected Timeline:**
- IND submission: Day 0
- FDA 30-day review period
- Clinical hold or proceed: Day 30
- First patient enrolled: Day 60-90 (assuming no clinical hold)

### 9.2 Informed Consent & Ethical Considerations

**Consent Process:**

CONVERGE requires comprehensive informed consent addressing:

1. **Experimental Nature**: This is a research study testing a new combination and sequence
2. **Risks**: Detailed description of known risks from each agent, plus potential unknown risks from combination
3. **Alternatives**: Standard treatment options (continued chemotherapy, hospice, other trials)
4. **Benefits**: Potential for clinical benefit but no guarantee; contribution to science
5. **Research Biopsies**: Additional risks and discomfort from optional biopsies
6. **Biospecimen Use**: How tissue and blood will be used, stored, and potentially shared

**Special Ethical Considerations:**

**Vulnerable Population:**
- Patients with refractory cancer may feel pressured to enroll
- Clear communication that declining does not affect standard care
- Independent patient advocate available for consultation

**Therapeutic Misconception:**
- Patients may overestimate likelihood of personal benefit
- Consent emphasizes primary purpose is to answer scientific question
- Realistic statistics presented: historical DCR 15-20%, target 50%, uncertainty significant

**Biopsy Burden:**
- Biopsies are optional; patients can enroll in trial without biopsies
- Clear distinction between medically necessary and research biopsies
- Compensation provided for research biopsies

**Data Sharing:**
- Patients informed that de-identified data will be shared publicly
- Option to withdraw from data sharing (though not from safety reporting)

### 9.3 Phase 2 Regulatory Innovation (Future Direction)

**Long-Term Vision:** Create regulatory pathway for adaptive, biomarker-guided combination regimens

**Challenges:**
Current FDA paradigm approves:
- Specific drugs at specific doses
- Fixed combinations (Drug A + Drug B)
- Selected populations (biomarker-positive)

CONVERGE Phase 2 envisions:
- **Adaptive duration** based on ctDNA kinetics
- **Modular combinations** (choose from pre-approved options)
- **AI-guided decision logic** for treatment adaptation

**Regulatory Pathway Design:**

**Year 1-3 (During Phase 1):**
- Informal FDA discussions at scientific meetings
- Present Phase 1 data demonstrating biomarker utility
- Propose "platform protocol" concept

**Year 4-5 (Phase 2 Planning):**
- **Type C Meeting** with FDA Oncology Division
- Present "System-of-Cure" concept:
  - Core regimen with pre-specified modification rules
  - Biomarker thresholds for treatment adaptation
  - Safety guardrails
- Request feedback on approvability pathway

**Year 6-8 (Phase 2 Execution):**
- **Master Protocol** design with:
  - Fixed backbone regimen (approved in Phase 1)

## 10. FUTURE DIRECTIONS & PATH TO PHASE 2

### 10.1 Success Criteria for Phase 2 Advancement

CONVERGE Phase 1 will trigger Phase 2 development if **BOTH** criteria are met:

**Criterion 1: Clinical Efficacy Signal**
- ≥18/35 patients (51%) achieve DCR at 6 months
- This exceeds the pre-specified threshold of 50% and is clinically meaningful vs. 15-20% historical benchmark

**Criterion 2: Mechanistic Validation**
- Paired biopsy analysis demonstrates ≥1.5-fold increase in CD8+ T-cell density in ≥60% of patients
- This provides biological evidence that PRIME hypothesis is correct

**Rationale for Dual Criteria:**
Clinical signal alone could be false positive or non-specific. Mechanistic validation ensures we understand *why* it worked, enabling rational Phase 2 design.

### 10.2 Phase 2 Program Overview

**If Phase 1 Success Criteria Met:**

**Funding Target:** $100-150M over 5 years

**Objective:** Transform proof-of-concept into regulatory approval pathway

**Three Parallel Initiatives:**

#### Initiative 1: Biomarker-Selected Expansion Trial ($60M)

**Design:**
- Multi-center, randomized Phase II/III
- Population: MSS mCRC patients selected by baseline biomarker (defined from Phase 1 data)
  - Example: High baseline tumor mutational burden (TMB ≥10 mut/Mb)
  - Example: Presence of immunogenic driver mutations
  - Example: Elevated IFN-γ signature in archival tissue

**Arms:**
- **Arm A (Control)**: Investigator's choice of standard chemotherapy
- **Arm B (CONVERGE)**: Prime-and-Attack regimen from Phase 1
- **Arm C (Adaptive)**: Prime-and-Attack with ctDNA-guided duration

**Sample Size:** 300 patients (100 per arm)

**Primary Endpoint:** 
- Phase II portion: DCR at 6 months
- Phase III portion: Progression-free survival (PFS)

**Key Innovation:**
- Real-time biomarker monitoring in Arm C
- Algorithm-guided treatment stopping when ctDNA clears
- Economic analysis: Cost-effectiveness of biomarker-adaptive approach

#### Initiative 2: Multi-Cancer Expansion ($40M)

**Rationale:** 
If PRIME hypothesis validated in MSS mCRC, test in other immunologically cold tumors

**Target Cancers:**
1. **Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma** (PDAC)
   - Similar cold TME
   - Targetable mutations (KRAS G12C, HER2)
   - Desperate unmet need (5-year survival <10%)

2. **Ovarian cancer (high-grade serous)**
   - Immunologically cold despite high mutational burden
   - PARP inhibitor sensitivity could be PRIME strategy
   - Existing checkpoint inhibitor data mixed

3. **Glioblastoma**
   - Immunologically privileged site
   - Limited treatment options post-surgery/radiation
   - Could PRIME overcome blood-brain barrier limitations?

**Design:**
- Parallel single-arm Phase II trials (N=30-40 each)
- Same CONVERGE framework adapted to each cancer
- PRIME strategy tailored to available targeted agents
- Shared biomarker platform and analysis

**Deliverable:**
- Proof that convergent cure approach generalizable across solid tumors
- Identification of which tumor types most likely to benefit

#### Initiative 3: Manufacturing Innovation ($50M)

**Problem:** 
Even if CONVERGE works, bispecific antibody manufacturing is expensive and limited capacity

**Solution:** 
Develop "off-the-shelf" cell therapy to replace bispecific antibody

**Approach:**

**Universal CAR-NK Cells:**
- Engineer iPSC-derived natural killer cells with CARs targeting multiple tumor antigens
- "Universal donor" cells (HLA-independent) = no matching required
- Can be manufactured at scale and cryopreserved

**Advantages over Bispecific:**
- **Cost**: Target <$20,000 per dose (vs. >$100,000 for some bispecifics)
- **Availability**: Immediate availability (no patient-specific manufacturing)
- **Persistence**: Longer half-life than antibodies
- **Multi-targeting**: Can engineer multiple CARs on same cell

**Development Plan:**

**Years 1-2: Preclinical Development**
- Engineer iPSC lines with tumor antigen-targeting CARs
- Optimize cell expansion and cryopreservation
- Validate in mouse models of MSS CRC

**Year 3: IND-Enabling Studies**
- GMP manufacturing process development
- Toxicology studies
- IND submission for Phase I

**Years 4-5: Phase I Trial**
- Dose-escalation study in refractory MSS mCRC
- CAR-NK cells as monotherapy to establish safety
- If safe, combine with PRIME strategy (targeted therapy + CAR-NK + checkpoint inhibitor)

**Deliverable:**
- "CONVERGE 2.0" regimen with scalable, affordable cell therapy component
- Path to functional cure accessible to all patients, not just those at academic centers

### 10.3 Path to Clinical Practice & Health Equity

**Challenge:**
Even if CONVERGE achieves regulatory approval, access barriers could prevent widespread benefit:
- **Cost**: Bispecific antibodies and combination regimens expensive
- **Expertise**: Complex regimens require specialized centers
- **Monitoring**: ctDNA monitoring not universally available

**Solutions:**

**Reimbursement Strategy:**
- **Comparative effectiveness data**: Demonstrate cost-effectiveness vs. continuous chemotherapy
- **Budget impact model**: Show long-term savings from cure (no ongoing treatment costs)
- **Payer engagement**: Early discussions with CMS and private insurers

**Community Oncology Access:**
- **Training program**: Develop CONVERGE prescriber certification
- **Telemedicine support**: Academic centers provide remote consultation for community oncologists
- **Simplified monitoring**: Identify minimum biomarker panel sufficient for safe administration

**Global Access:**
- **Technology transfer**: Partner with manufacturers in India, Brazil, China
- **Tiered pricing**: Advocate for differential pricing based on GDP
- **Clinical trial network**: Expand Phase 2 to include international sites (especially LMICs)

**Equity Monitoring:**
- Track enrollment demographics in Phase 2 trials
- Ensure representation of underserved populations (racial/ethnic minorities, rural communities)
- Partner with community health centers for trial recruitment

### 10.4 Scientific Legacy Beyond Clinical Outcomes

**Even if CONVERGE does not achieve regulatory approval**, the program will generate lasting scientific value:

**Public Dataset:**
- Largest paired biopsy + ctDNA dataset in MSS mCRC
- Benchmark for TME characterization in refractory disease
- Training data for AI/ML models of treatment response

**Mechanistic Insights:**
- Definitive test of "prime and attack" hypothesis
- Understanding of when and how TME reprogramming works (or doesn't)
- Identification of resistance mechanisms to guide next-generation approaches

**Methodological Advances:**
- Validation of serial biopsy feasibility in multicenter trials
- Integration of real-time biomarker monitoring into treatment decisions
- Blueprint for adaptive trial designs in oncology

**Collaborative Infrastructure:**
- Multi-institutional consortium that can be redeployed for future trials
- Standardized biomarker assays and analysis pipelines
- Relationships with pharma and diagnostic partners

**Training Pipeline:**
- >20 PhD students, postdocs, and clinical fellows trained in translational trial design
- Educational materials and protocols shared publicly
- Next generation of physician-scientists equipped to lead convergent cure trials

## 11. CONCLUSION: AN INVESTMENT IN DEFINITIVE INSIGHT

### The Opportunity

Functional cures exist in oncology, but they have remained confined to a narrow subset of blood cancers. The tools to achieve functional cure in solid tumors are available:
- Targeted therapies that disrupt oncogenic drivers
- Immunotherapies that harness the immune system
- Biomarkers that guide treatment decisions in real-time
- Manufacturing platforms that enable scalable production

**What has been missing is a systematic, hypothesis-driven effort to integrate these tools with precision and purpose.**

### The CONVERGE Approach

Project CONVERGE provides that systematic effort. It is:

**Focused:** One cancer (MSS mCRC), one clear hypothesis (Prime and Attack), one definitive experiment

**Rigorous:** Simon two-stage design with pre-specified Go/No-Go milestones, powered statistical analysis, independent safety monitoring

**Mechanistic:** Mandatory biopsies and intensive biomarker monitoring ensure we understand why the regimen succeeds or fails

**Pragmatic:** Uses approved agents, conventional regulatory pathway, achievable enrollment targets

**Responsible:** Transparent failure analysis plan, public data sharing, guaranteed scientific value regardless of outcome

### The Investment

We request **$32 million in direct funding** over 3 years. This investment will:

**Generate Three Definitive Datasets:**
1. Clinical efficacy signal in 35 patients with refractory MSS mCRC
2. Mechanistic validation of TME reprogramming through paired biopsies
3. Predictive biomarker model using ctDNA kinetics

**Provide Clear Decision Gates:**
- Stage 1 futility analysis at 17 patients prevents wasteful spending if regimen doesn't work
- Success triggers well-defined path to Phase 2 ($100-150M investment)
- Failure generates insights that redirect field away from dead-end approach

**Deliver Lasting Value:**
- Public dataset enabling future research
- Trained workforce of translational scientists
- Operational infrastructure for next-generation trials
- Regulatory pathway proof-of-concept for adaptive regimens

### The Choice

The field of oncology stands at a crossroads:

**Path 1 (Current Trajectory):**
- Continue incremental advances with single agents
- Median survival in refractory MSS mCRC improves from 6 months to 8 months
- Patients live longer but never stop treatment
- Costs continue to escalate without achieving cure

**Path 2 (CONVERGE):**
- Test whether strategic integration can achieve what individual therapies cannot
- Risk $32M to answer a definitive question
- If successful: transform refractory disease into curable disease
- If unsuccessful: learn why and redirect resources to better approaches

### The Urgency

40,000 Americans are diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer every year. 85% have MSS disease. Current treatment offers months to a few years, never cure.

**Every year we delay is another cohort of patients who will never benefit from a convergent approach.**

The biology is ready. The tools are available. The team is assembled. The design is rigorous.

**What is needed now is the commitment to execute this vision.**

### The Ask

We are seeking founding partners—public funders, private foundations, and strategic industry partners—who recognize that transformative progress requires bold, hypothesis-driven science.

**Initial commitments sought:**
- **$20M**: Public funding (NCI, Stand Up To Cancer, V Foundation)
- **$8M**: In-kind contributions from pharma/diagnostics partners (secured)
- **$4M**: Philanthropic funding from patient advocacy organizations and family foundations

**Timeline:**
- **Month 0-3**: Finalize funding commitments and partnerships
- **Month 3-6**: Regulatory submission and site activation
- **Month 6-30**: Patient enrollment and treatment
- **Month 30-36**: Final analysis and publication
- **Month 36-48**: Phase 2 planning and funding (if Phase 1 successful)

### The Promise

We promise:
- **Transparency**: Quarterly progress reports to all funders
- **Rigor**: Independent DSMB oversight and statistical analysis
- **Communication**: Results published in high-impact journals regardless of outcome
- **Access**: All data made publicly available for secondary analyses
- **Efficiency**: Every dollar spent generates lasting scientific value

### The Vision

CONVERGE is not the end goal. It is the first step in a decade-long initiative to:
1. Prove that convergent approaches can achieve functional cure
2. Identify which patients benefit and which biomarkers predict success
3. Scale from single-cancer proof-of-concept to multi-cancer platform
4. Innovate manufacturing to make cures affordable and accessible
5. Transform regulatory pathways to enable adaptive, personalized regimens

**The outcome will be a new paradigm in oncology: not treating cancer indefinitely, but systematically achieving functional cures.**

### The Call to Action

The science is converging. The need is urgent. The opportunity is now.

# PROJECT CONVERGE
## Executive Summary for Funders

**A Mechanistic Proof-of-Concept Trial for Functional Cure in Refractory Solid Tumors**

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Functional cures exist in oncology** — imatinib for CML, allogeneic transplant for acute leukemia — but they remain confined to blood cancers. 

**40,000 Americans annually** develop metastatic colorectal cancer; 85% have microsatellite stable (MSS) disease that is resistant to immunotherapy and has median survival of 6-9 months after standard treatments fail.

**The tools to achieve functional cure in solid tumors exist:** targeted therapies, immunotherapies, real-time biomarkers. **What is missing:** a systematic, hypothesis-driven effort to integrate them with precision.

---

## THE CONVERGE HYPOTHESIS

**Resistance in MSS mCRC is contextual, not absolute.** A strategically sequenced approach can overcome it:

1. **PRIME** (Weeks 1-8): Targeted therapy induces tumor stress and antigen release, inflaming the cold tumor microenvironment
2. **ATTACK** (Months 2-12): Dual immunotherapy (checkpoint blockade + T-cell engager) exploits this window to establish immune control
3. **ADAPT** (Future): Biomarker-guided duration enables treatment-free intervals

---

## THE TRIAL

### Design
- **Phase II, Simon two-stage** with clear Go/No-Go milestones
- **N=35 patients** with refractory MSS mCRC (3rd/4th line)
- **Primary endpoint:** Disease Control Rate at 6 months
- **Target:** ≥50% DCR (vs. 15-20% historical benchmark)

### Three Integrated Components

**1. Clinical Efficacy Signal ($21M)**
- Test PRIME-and-ATTACK regimen in 35 patients
- Stage 1 futility analysis at 17 patients prevents wasteful spending
- Uses only FDA-approved agents in novel sequence

**2. Mechanistic Validation ($6M)**
- Mandatory serial tumor biopsies (baseline and post-PRIME)
- Multiplex immune profiling and RNA sequencing
- **Definitively tests:** Does PRIME reprogram the tumor microenvironment?

**3. Predictive Biomarker Model ($3M)**
- Intensive ctDNA monitoring (420 longitudinal samples)
- Correlate early biomarker changes with durable outcomes
- Build algorithm for patient selection in Phase 2

---

## THE INNOVATION

**This is not just another Phase II trial.** It is a $32M knowledge platform that generates definitive answers regardless of clinical outcome:

### If Successful (≥50% DCR):
- **Phase 2 advancement:** Biomarker-selected expansion to 300 patients
- **Multi-cancer application:** Test in pancreatic, ovarian, brain cancers
- **Manufacturing innovation:** Develop affordable cell therapy replacement
- **Total Phase 2 investment:** $100-150M

### If Unsuccessful (<50% DCR):
- **Still valuable:** Paired biopsy data reveals why TME reprogramming failed
- **Prevents waste:** Saves field from pursuing dead-end $100M+ Phase 3 trial
- **Public dataset:** Benchmark for future MSS mCRC immunotherapy studies
- **Clear answer:** Redirects resources to better approaches

---

## THE ASK

**Total Direct Costs: $32 Million over 3 years**

### Funding Mix (Target):
- **$20M** (62%): Public funding (NCI, Stand Up To Cancer, V Foundation)
- **$8M** (25%): In-kind contributions (SECURED from pharma/diagnostic partners)
- **$4M** (13%): Philanthropic funding (patient advocacy, family foundations)

### Budget Justification:
| Investment | Delivers |
|------------|----------|
| $21M | Clinical efficacy signal with 80% statistical power |
| $6M | Mechanistic validation through 70 paired biopsies |
| $3M | Predictive biomarker model from 420 ctDNA samples |
| $2M | Reusable infrastructure for Phase 2 |

**Cost per definitive answer: $10.7M** (three answers from one trial)

*Project CONVERGE: A Mechanistic Proof-of-Concept Trial for Functional Cure in Refractory Solid Tumors*  

# PROJECT CONVERGE - ONE-PAGE OVERVIEW
**A $32M Investment to Test Whether Strategic Integration Can Achieve Functional Cures in Solid Tumors**

---

## THE PROBLEM
- **40,000 Americans/year** develop metastatic colorectal cancer
- **85% have MSS disease** — resistant to immunotherapy, median survival 6-9 months after standard therapy fails
- **Functional cures exist** (imatinib for CML, transplant for leukemia) but **not in solid tumors**

## THE HYPOTHESIS
**Resistance is contextual, not absolute.** Strategically sequenced therapy can overcome it:

```
PRIME (Weeks 1-8)          →    ATTACK (Months 2-12)           →    ADAPT (Future)
Targeted Therapy                 Dual Immunotherapy                  Treatment-Free Remission
• Induces tumor stress           • Checkpoint inhibitor              • Biomarker-guided stopping
• Releases antigens              • T-cell engager                    • Functional cure
• Inflames cold TME              • Exploits immune window
```

## THE TRIAL DESIGN

**Phase II, Simon Two-Stage | N=35 patients | 3 years | $32M**

| Component | Investment | Delivers | Go/No-Go |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Clinical Efficacy** | $21M | 50% Disease Control Rate at 6 months (vs. 15-20% historical) | Stage 1: If <5/17 respond → STOP (save $17M) |
| **Mechanistic Validation** | $6M | Paired biopsies prove PRIME reprograms tumor microenvironment | CD8+ T-cell infiltration ≥2-fold increase |
| **Predictive Biomarkers** | $3M | ctDNA model enables patient selection for Phase 2 | Correlation: ctDNA clearance → durable response |
| **Infrastructure** | $2M | Consortium, data platform, regulatory pathway | Reusable for Phase 2 ($100-150M) |

## THE THREE SCENARIOS

### ✅ SUCCESS (≥18/35 with DCR + mechanistic validation)
→ **Phase 2:** Biomarker-selected trial (300 patients, $60M)  
→ **Multi-cancer expansion:** Pancreatic, ovarian, brain (3 trials, $40M)  
→ **Manufacturing innovation:** Affordable cell therapy platform ($50M)  
→ **TOTAL PHASE 2: $150M | Potential regulatory approval by Year 10**

### ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS (Clinical signal but no mechanism OR mechanism but weak clinical signal)
→ **Pivot:** Redesign sequence/agents based on correlative data  
→ **New Phase 1:** Modified regimen with $25M follow-on trial  
→ **Value:** Learned what to change for next iteration

### ❌ FAILURE (<5/17 in Stage 1 OR <18/35 total with DCR)
→ **STOP trial early** (save $17M if Stage 1 failure)  
→ **Publish all data** within 12 months (prevent others from repeating mistake)  
→ **Value:** $15M invested to definitively show this approach doesn't work  
→ **Still generates:** Benchmark dataset, mechanistic insights, resistance mechanisms

## THE INNOVATION: THREE ANSWERS FROM ONE TRIAL

Most Phase II trials answer one question: "Does it work?"  
**CONVERGE answers three:**

1. **Clinical:** Does convergent therapy achieve durable control?
2. **Mechanistic:** Does PRIME reprogram the TME? (reveals WHY it works or doesn't)
3. **Predictive:** Can early biomarkers select future responders?

**Value proposition:** Even if clinical endpoint missed, biopsy + ctDNA data worth $20M+ to the field

## THE FUNDING MODEL

| Source | Amount | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Public** (NCI, SU2C, V Foundation) | $20M (62%) | **SEEKING** |
| **In-Kind** (Pharma, Diagnostics) | $8M (25%) | **SECURED** |
| **Philanthropic** (Advocacy, Family) | $4M (13%) | **SEEKING** |
| **TOTAL PROJECT VALUE** | **$40M** | — |

**Why the leverage matters:** Every $1 of direct funding generates $1.25 in total value

## THE RISK MITIGATION

**Every major risk has a contingency:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Slow accrual** | 8-10 high-volume sites, patient advocacy recruitment, 24-month timeline |
| **No pharma partner** | Budget includes commercial drug acquisition ($5.25M contingency) |
| **Excessive toxicity** | Safety run-in, DSMB oversight, pre-specified stopping rules |
| **Biopsy failure** | 80% completion assumed, patients can enroll without biopsies |
| **Budget overrun** | $2M contingency (6% of budget), quarterly financial monitoring |

**Statistical rigor:** 80% power, Simon two-stage with early stopping, historically controlled endpoint

## THE TIMELINE

```
Month 0  →  Month 3  →  Month 6  →  Month 18  →  Month 24  →  Month 36  →  Month 48
FUNDING     IND         FIRST      STAGE 1      GO/NO-GO     RESULTS      PHASE 2
CLOSE       APPROVAL    PATIENT    COMPLETE     DECISION     PUBLISHED    LAUNCH
```

**Key Decision Point:** Month 24 — if ≥5/17 patients respond → invest $17M more for Stage 2  
**If <5/17 respond → STOP, publish, pivot (saved $17M)**

## THE TEAM

- **PI:** Leading GI oncologist at NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center [recruitment in progress]
- **Coordinating Center:** Dana-Farber / MD Anderson / MSKCC [finalizing]
- **Sites:** 8-10 high-volume cancer centers across US
- **Partners:** Pharma (Amgen/Regeneron/J&J), Diagnostics (Guardant/Foundation), Patient Advocacy (CRC Alliance)

## THE DIFFERENTIATORS

**Why CONVERGE succeeds where others fail:**

1. ✅ **Focused:** One cancer, one hypothesis, one definitive experiment (not building entire platform)
2. ✅ **Rigorous:** Simon two-stage with mechanistic validation (not just clinical signal)
3. ✅ **Pragmatic:** FDA-approved agents, conventional regulatory pathway (not waiting for new tools)
4. ✅ **Value-certain:** Generates lasting scientific insight even if clinical trial "fails"

## THE IMPACT PROJECTION

| Timeframe | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| **Years 1-4** | Definitive test of convergent cure hypothesis in MSS mCRC |
| **Years 5-8** | If successful: Multi-cancer platform + affordable manufacturing |
| **Years 9-15** | Paradigm shift: Treating to cure, not just treating to extend life |
| **Long-term** | Training pipeline of translational scientists, regulatory innovation for adaptive trials |

## THE ASK

**We are seeking $24M in new commitments** (to complement $8M secured in-kind)

**Priority Funding Partners:**
- **Stand Up To Cancer** ($12-15M) — Dream Team Award [best fit for multi-institutional convergent approach]
- **V Foundation** ($5-8M) — Translational Research Award
- **NCI ETCTN** ($8-10M) — Experimental Therapeutics Network
- **Philanthropic** ($4M) — Patient advocacy foundations and family offices

**Timeline:** Seeking commitments within 6 months to launch trial by Month 6

## THE CLOSING MESSAGE

> **"We have the biology. We have the tools. We have the team. What we need now is the commitment to execute a definitive experiment. $32M will either prove that systematic integration achieves functional cures in solid tumors—or definitively show why it doesn't and redirect the field accordingly. Both outcomes are of immense value. Let's find out which one is true."**
