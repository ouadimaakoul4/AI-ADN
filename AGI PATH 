1. Introduction: Current State (December 2025)

2. Mathematical Foundations

2.1 Electrokinetic Propulsion in Low Reynolds Number Regime

Physics: Propulsion via induced-charge electro-osmosis in dilute peroxide:

v_{\text{slip}} = -\frac{\epsilon}{\eta} \left(\zeta E - \frac{1}{2} \nabla \zeta^2\right) + v_{\text{thermal noise}}

where thermal noise is significant (Brownian motion ~10 μm/s RMS).

Physical context: At Re ~10⁻³, viscous forces dominate, fundamentally altering control dynamics.

Operating window:

· Fluid conductivity: 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻² S/m (optimized for dilute H₂O₂)
· Voltage: 100-300 mV (electrolysis threshold limited)
· Lifetime: ~10⁷ actuation cycles before degradation

2.2 Power Budget Analysis

Energy calculation:

P_{\text{available}} = \eta_{\text{PV}} \times I_{\text{illumination}} \times A_{\text{active}} \times (1 - R_{\text{coverage}})

Example at standard illumination:

\eta_{\text{PV}} = 0.15,\ I_{\text{illumination}} = 50\ \text{mW/cm}^2,\ A_{\text{active}} = 4900\ \mu\text{m}^2,\ R_{\text{coverage}} = 0.45

P_{\text{available}} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-11}\ \text{W} = 20\ \text{pW}

Practical limits: 20 pW at 200 mV supports ~10 kHz clock frequency with current designs.

Computation specifications:

· Clock frequency: 1-10 kHz
· Memory: 128-512 bits (design dependent)
· Instructions: 64-128 programmable operations
· Addressing: Hundreds individually programmable via optical IDs

2.3 Information Theory of Motion-Based Communication

Measured capabilities:

C_{\text{measured}} = 5-20\ \text{bits/second}

Scaling limitations:

1. Viscous damping response time: \tau \sim \eta L^2/kT \approx 0.1\ \text{s}
2. Positional uncertainty: \sigma_{\text{position}} \approx \sqrt{2Dt} \sim 1-2\ \mu\text{m}
3. Signal-to-noise degradation: For N > 50, \text{S/N} \propto 1/\sqrt{N}

Address space:
With 8-photodiode arrays:

N_{\text{addressable}} = 2^8 = 256\ \text{(theoretical)}

N_{\text{demonstrated}} \approx 100\ \text{simultaneously programmable}

3. Manufacturing and Economics

3.1 Yield Analysis

For 200 mm wafers:

Y_{\text{current}} = Y_{\text{CMOS}} \times Y_{\text{release}} \times Y_{\text{functional}} \times Y_{\text{test}}

where:

· Y_{\text{CMOS}} = 0.95 (standard CMOS yield)
· Y_{\text{release}} = 0.85 (sacrificial layer etch)
· Y_{\text{functional}} = 0.40-0.50 (operational devices)
· Y_{\text{test}} = 0.80 (post-release testing)

Result: ~30% overall yield → ~300,000 functional robots per million attempted

3.2 Cost Projections

Current research-scale:

C_{\text{research}} = \$5,000-\$10,000\ \text{per wafer} \rightarrow \$0.017-\$0.033\ \text{per robot}

Historical analogy: CMOS cost reduction mirrors solar PV trajectory:

· 1970s: $100/W → 2020s: $0.30/W (300× reduction)
· Projection: Similar scaling feasible for micro-robots

Production scale projection (2030):

C_{\text{production}} = \$1,000\ \text{per wafer} \rightarrow \$0.003-\$0.010\ \text{per functional robot}

assuming volume manufacturing and improved yields (>95% functional yield)
