Beyond Turing: A Comprehensive Cognitive Evaluation Framework for Artificial Intelligence

A Theoretical Framework and Mathematical Architecture


Abstract

The Turing test has served as a conceptual benchmark for machine intelligence for over seventy years, but its binary, behavior-oriented nature is increasingly inadequate for assessing the multifaceted cognitive capabilities of modern AI systems. This thesis presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for evaluating artificial intelligence across nine distinct cognitive dimensions: grounded perception, causal reasoning, planning, metacognition, autonomous learning, social behavior, creativity, robustness, and developmental scalability. Each dimension is formalized with rigorous metrics, uncertainty quantification, and normalized scoring. The framework introduces a flexible aggregation scheme based on the generalized power mean, which captures different notions of capability integration—from fully compensatory (additive) to weakest-link (geometric) and safety-oriented (minimum). Explicit uncertainty propagation ensures statistical rigor. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on narrow tasks, this work provides a unified, extensible architecture for multidimensional cognitive assessment. The contribution is purely theoretical: a mathematically grounded specification that can serve as a foundation for future implementation and empirical validation. By moving beyond simple behavioral imitation to a structured evaluation of cognitive faculties, this framework aims to guide the development and responsible deployment of increasingly capable AI systems.

Keywords: AI evaluation, cognitive architecture, mathematical framework, uncertainty quantification, multidimensional assessment, power-mean aggregation

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 Motivation

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence—from task-specific models to general-purpose systems—has outpaced our ability to evaluate their capabilities meaningfully. The Turing test (Turing, 1950), while historically significant, offers a binary outcome based on imitation rather than a nuanced assessment of cognitive faculties. Modern AI systems exhibit behaviors that span perception, reasoning, learning, social interaction, and creativity, yet no unified framework exists to quantify these diverse dimensions in a coherent, mathematically rigorous manner.

Stakeholders—researchers, developers, policymakers, and the public—require transparent, reliable, and comprehensive methods to understand what AI systems can and cannot do. Without such methods, claims of "human-level" intelligence remain subjective, and risks associated with deployment cannot be properly assessed. This thesis addresses this gap by proposing a theoretical framework for multidimensional cognitive evaluation.

1.2 Problem Statement

The central problem is the absence of a formal, extensible architecture that can measure an AI system's cognitive capabilities across multiple dimensions simultaneously, with explicit treatment of uncertainty and comparability across systems. Existing benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, HELM) are valuable but typically focus on narrow task performance and lack a unifying cognitive model. Furthermore, they rarely incorporate uncertainty quantification, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine capability and statistical fluctuation.

This thesis poses the following research questions:

1. How can cognitive capabilities be decomposed into a set of theoretically grounded, measurable dimensions?
2. What mathematical formalism enables the quantification of each dimension with associated uncertainty?
3. How can individual dimension scores be aggregated into a composite assessment that reflects different notions of capability integration?
4. What design principles ensure the framework is extensible, interpretable, and statistically rigorous?

1.3 Contributions

The main contributions of this thesis are:

· A nine-dimensional cognitive taxonomy derived from cognitive science and AI research, covering perception, reasoning, planning, metacognition, learning, sociality, creativity, robustness, and developmental scalability.
· Mathematical formalizations for each dimension, including metrics, uncertainty bounds, and normalization procedures.
· A flexible aggregation scheme based on the generalized power mean, which unifies additive, geometric, and minimum aggregation under a single parameter and enables a novel balance index to quantify capability harmony.
· Explicit uncertainty propagation formulas for composite scores.
· A complete architectural specification for an evaluation battery (the ECP-B) that can be implemented in software.
· A theoretical analysis of the framework's limitations and the inherent constraints of cognitive measurement.

This work is purely theoretical; it does not present empirical results. Instead, it provides a foundation upon which empirical studies can be built.

1.4 Thesis Outline

Chapter 2 reviews related work in AI evaluation, cognitive taxonomies, and recent multidimensional frameworks, highlighting gaps. Chapter 3 establishes the mathematical tools used throughout the framework. Chapter 4 details each cognitive dimension with its formal definition. Chapter 5 describes the overall architecture of the evaluation battery, including scoring and uncertainty. Chapter 6 discusses theoretical limitations and avenues for future research. Chapter 7 concludes with a summary of contributions and implications.

Chapter 2: Background and Related Work

2.1 The Turing Test and Its Limitations

The Turing test (Turing, 1950) proposes that a machine exhibits intelligence if it can imitate human conversation indistinguishably. While influential, the test has been critiqued for focusing on deception rather than understanding (Searle, 1980), for being anthropocentric, and for lacking quantitative rigor. Modern AI systems can pass restricted versions (e.g., in chatbots) without possessing general intelligence, underscoring the need for more structured evaluation.

2.2 Existing Evaluation Frameworks

A plethora of benchmarks have emerged to assess specific capabilities:

· Natural language understanding: GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)
· Reasoning: BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022), ARC (Clark et al., 2018)
· Vision: ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015), COCO (Lin et al., 2014)
· Reinforcement learning: Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013), Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020)
· Safety and robustness: AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020)

These benchmarks excel at measuring performance on predefined tasks but are not designed to provide a holistic cognitive profile. They often lack uncertainty quantification and do not model interactions between capabilities.

2.3 Cognitive Taxonomies in AI

Efforts to categorize AI capabilities draw from cognitive psychology. Frameworks like the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence (McGrew, 2009) inspire multidimensional assessment. In AI, the "AI Index" (Stanford HAI, annual) tracks progress across various dimensions but does not offer a unified scoring system. The "ARC" evaluation (Chollet, 2019) emphasizes abstraction and reasoning but is limited to a specific construct.

2.4 Recent Multidimensional Frameworks (2024–2026)

Several recent initiatives have proposed multidimensional evaluation architectures:

· OECD AI Capability Indicators (June 2025): Defines nine capability domains with five-level scales up to human equivalence, covering language, social interaction, creativity, robotics intelligence, etc. It provides a policy-oriented descriptive framework but lacks mathematical aggregation and uncertainty quantification.
· CAIE Framework (Jan 2026): Proposes over 90 fine-grained cognitive features grouped into six zones (Learning & Adaptation, Perception, Reasoning, Interaction, Memory, Optimization). It uses a two-stage scoring (ZUCS/SZUCS) with maturity gaps, offering high granularity but less mathematical cohesion.
· ARIA (2025): Introduces five responsibility dimensions with context-adaptive weighting, a Monte-Carlo uncertainty penalty, and cascading penalties for critical weaknesses. Its spirit aligns closely with our robustness and safety dimension.
· HELM (updated versions), ARC-AGI-2 (2025), and DeepMind's Levels of AGI (Morris et al., 2024) continue to refine task-based evaluation but remain largely benchmark-oriented.

These frameworks highlight the growing consensus that multidimensional assessment is essential. However, they either lack mathematical rigor in aggregation, ignore uncertainty, or are too coarse/fine for practical use. The ECP-B framework fills this gap by providing a unified, uncertainty-aware, and mathematically disciplined architecture.

2.5 The Need for a Unified Mathematical Architecture

The convergence of AI research toward general-purpose systems demands an evaluation methodology that reflects the breadth of human-like cognition. A mathematically grounded framework allows for:

· Identifying strengths and weaknesses across capabilities
· Tracking progress over time in a standardized manner
· Informing risk assessment and deployment decisions
· Encouraging research on underdeveloped dimensions

This thesis builds on prior work by synthesizing diverse metrics into a coherent mathematical architecture with explicit uncertainty handling and a flexible aggregation scheme.

Chapter 3: Mathematical Foundations

3.1 Uncertainty Quantification in Measurement

Any measurement of an AI system's performance is subject to variability due to task sampling, stochasticity in the system, and limited test data. To make meaningful comparisons, we must quantify this uncertainty.

Let X be a random variable representing the outcome of an evaluation trial. For a given dimension, we obtain a set of observations \{x_1, \dots, x_N\}. The sample mean \hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N}\sum x_i estimates the true capability, and the standard error \sigma_{\hat{\mu}} = s/\sqrt{N} (where s is sample standard deviation) provides a measure of uncertainty. Confidence intervals can be constructed using the t-distribution:

CI = \hat{\mu} \pm t_{1-\alpha/2, N-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}.

3.2 Normalization and Reference Standards

To compare across dimensions and systems, raw scores must be normalized to a common scale, typically [0,1]. This requires reference points:

· Absolute reference D^*: the maximum theoretically achievable score (e.g., perfect performance).
· Human reference D^{\text{human}}: average performance of expert humans.
· State-of-the-art reference D^{\text{SOTA}}: best performance among existing systems.
· Baseline reference D^{\text{base}}: performance of a trivial system (e.g., random guessing).

Normalized score:

D_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\text{raw} - D^{\text{base}}}{D^{\text{ref}} - D^{\text{base}}},

where D^{\text{ref}} is chosen according to context. Clipping ensures D_{\text{norm}} \in [0,1].

3.3 Aggregation Theory: From Additive to Multiplicative Models

A composite score can combine individual dimension scores. Two canonical forms are:

· Additive: S_{\text{add}} = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i D_i with \sum w_i = 1.
· Multiplicative (geometric): S_{\text{geo}} = \prod_{i=1}^n D_i^{w_i}.

Additive models assume independence and compensability (a low score in one dimension can be offset by a high score in another). Geometric models penalize low scores more severely and reflect a notion that capabilities synergize multiplicatively. By the weighted AM–GM inequality, S_{\text{geo}} \leq S_{\text{add}}, with equality iff all D_i are equal.

3.4 The Generalized Power Mean Family

To unify these and other aggregation modes, we adopt the generalized power mean (also known as the Hölder mean):

M_p(\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{w}) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n w_i D_i^p \right)^{1/p}, \quad p \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, \infty\},

with the understanding that:

· p = 1 gives the weighted arithmetic mean (additive).
· p \to 0 gives the weighted geometric mean  \prod D_i^{w_i} .
· p = -1 gives the harmonic mean.
· p \to -\infty gives the minimum: \min_i D_i.
· p \to \infty gives the maximum: \max_i D_i.

The parameter p controls the "compensatoriness" of the aggregation: higher p allows high scores to compensate for low ones; lower p emphasizes the weakest dimensions.

We define the ECP composite score as:

S(p) = M_p(\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{w}).

The choice of p depends on the evaluation context:

· For overall capability assessment where balance is valued, p=0 (geometric) is appropriate.
· For safety-critical applications, a low p (e.g., p=-1 or p \to -\infty) ensures that the composite reflects the weakest dimension.
· For research comparisons where compensability is acceptable, p=1 may be used.

3.5 Synergy and Balance: A Reinterpretation

The ratio S_{\text{geo}} / S_{\text{add}} (or more generally M_0 / M_1) lies in [0,1] and measures the balance of capabilities: it is 1 when all dimensions are equal, and decreases as disparity increases. We define the Capability Balance Index (CBI) as:

\text{CBI} = 1 - \frac{M_0}{M_1} \in [0,1].

A CBI close to 0 indicates that capabilities are balanced; a high CBI signals that one or more weak dimensions drag down the geometric mean relative to the arithmetic mean, highlighting a potential vulnerability. This replaces the earlier flawed synergy metric.

3.6 Error Propagation and Confidence Intervals

Given normalized dimension scores D_i with uncertainties \Delta_i (e.g., standard errors), we propagate uncertainty through the power mean. For a general differentiable function S = f(\mathbf{D}), the first-order variance approximation is:

\Delta_S^2 \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial D_i} \right)^2 \Delta_i^2,

assuming uncorrelated errors. For the power mean with p \neq 0,

\frac{\partial S}{\partial D_i} = w_i \left( \frac{D_i}{S} \right)^{p-1} \quad \text{for } p \neq 0,

and for p=0 (geometric mean),

\frac{\partial S}{\partial D_i} = S \cdot \frac{w_i}{D_i}.

Thus:

· For p=0: \displaystyle \Delta_S = S \sqrt{ \sum_i \left( w_i \frac{\Delta_i}{D_i} \right)^2 }.
· For p=1: \displaystyle \Delta_S = \sqrt{ \sum_i (w_i \Delta_i)^2 }.
· For general p \neq 0,1: \displaystyle \Delta_S = \sqrt{ \sum_i \left( w_i \left( \frac{D_i}{S} \right)^{p-1} \Delta_i \right)^2 }.

Confidence intervals for the composite score are then S \pm k\Delta_S with k chosen for desired confidence (e.g., k=2 for ~95%).

Chapter 4: The ECP-B Framework: Cognitive Dimensions

The ECP-B (Extended Cognitive Profile Battery) defines nine dimensions, each capturing a distinct cognitive faculty. For each dimension, we provide a mathematical formalization, a rationale, and example tasks for measurement.

4.1 Overview of the Nine Dimensions

Dimension Description
D₁: Grounded Perception Ability to interpret sensory data in context
D₂: Causal Reasoning Understanding cause-effect relationships
D₃: Planning Sequential decision-making under uncertainty
D₄: Metacognition Self-assessment and confidence calibration
D₅: Autonomous Learning Sample efficiency and transfer
D₆: Social Behavior Theory of mind and cooperation
D₇: Creativity Novelty, utility, and diversity of solutions
D₈: Robustness & Safety Stability under distribution shift and attacks
D₉: Developmental Scalability Phase transitions in capability with scale

4.1.1 Synthesis from Cognitive Science

This taxonomy draws from multiple sources: CHC theory of human intelligence (McGrew, 2009) provides broad categories (fluid reasoning, crystallized knowledge, visual processing, etc.). Chollet's (2019) notion of abstraction and reasoning informs D₂ and D₃. Pearl's ladder of causation (Pearl, 2000) grounds D₂. Boden's (2004) creativity taxonomy (combinational, exploratory, transformational) inspires D₇. Social cognition research (Frith & Frith, 2012) underpins D₆. Robustness and safety are essential engineering dimensions emphasized in frameworks like ARIA (2025). Developmental scalability captures the observation that capabilities often emerge nonlinearly with scale (Kaplan et al., 2020).

4.2 Grounded Perception (D₁)

Definition: The capacity to extract meaningful representations from raw sensory input (e.g., images, audio, text) and to ground them in physical or semantic context.

Metrics:

· Accuracy on perception tasks: \text{Acc} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}[\hat{y}_i = y_i].
· Robustness to perturbations: \mathcal{R}_{\text{perc}} = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[\min_{\|\delta\|\le\epsilon} \mathbb{I}[f(x)=f(x+\delta)]].
· Grounding score: correctness of relational inferences (e.g., spatial reasoning: "Is the cube to the left of the sphere?").

Example tasks: VQA-v2 (visual question answering), CLEVR (relational reasoning), Winoground (visio-linguistic grounding).

Normalization: Compare to human accuracy and random baseline.

4.3 Causal Reasoning (D₂)

Definition: Ability to infer causal structures from observational and interventional data, and to predict outcomes under interventions.

· Causal discovery accuracy (e.g., structural Hamming distance between inferred and true DAG).
· Intervention prediction error: \frac{1}{N}\sum \|\hat{P}(Y|do(X=x)) - P_{\text{true}}(Y|do(X=x))\|.
· Counterfactual consistency: accuracy of "what if" predictions.

Example tasks: CausalBench (synthetic and real-world datasets), CLadder (causal reasoning in natural language), e-CARE (explanation generation).

Normalization: Structural Hamming Distance normalized by maximum possible distance.

4.4 Planning (D₃)

· Planning efficiency: \eta = \frac{J(\pi)-J(\pi_{\text{rand}})}{J(\pi_{\text{opt}})-J(\pi_{\text{rand}})}.
· Hierarchical planning depth: ability to decompose tasks into subgoals.

Example tasks: AgentBench (interactive tasks), WebArena (web navigation), BabyAI (hierarchical instruction following), Procgen (generalization in RL).

Normalization: Normalized return relative to optimal policy and random baseline.

4.5 Metacognition (D₄)

Definition: Self-awareness of one's own knowledge and uncertainty, and appropriate help-seeking.

Metrics:

· Calibration error (Brier score): \mathcal{B} = \frac{1}{N}\sum (p_i - \mathbb{I}[\text{correct}_i])^2.
· Help-seeking appropriateness: \text{HelpScore} = \frac{\text{appropriate requests} - \text{inappropriate}}{\text{total difficult tasks}}.
· Uncertainty discrimination: \mathbb{E}[\text{acc}|\text{high conf}] - \mathbb{E}[\text{acc}|\text{low conf}].

Example tasks: MMLU subsets with confidence prompts, "I don't know" options on ambiguous queries, self-correction on GSM8K with feedback.

Normalization: Brier score ranges 0–1 (0 perfect), converted to 1-\mathcal{B}.

4.6 Autonomous Learning (D₅)

Definition: Efficiency of learning from limited data, and ability to transfer knowledge to new domains.

Metrics:

· Learning exponent \alpha from power-law fit: \mathcal{L}(n) \propto n^{\alpha} (optimal \alpha = -1).
· Transfer ratio: \frac{\text{perf}_{\text{target}} - \text{perf}_{\text{base}}}{\text{perf}_{\text{source}} - \text{perf}_{\text{base}}}.
· Forgetting measure F = 1 - \frac{\text{perf}_{\text{retention}}}{\text{perf}_{\text{original}}} (lower is better).

Example tasks: Few-shot transfer on SuperGLUE, continual learning on CoNLL (with forgetting curves), domain adaptation on DomainNet.

Normalization: Learning exponent normalized to [0,1] via e.g., \max(0, \min(1, 1+\alpha)) (since optimal is -1, random might be 0).

4.7 Social Behavior (D₆)

Definition: Capacity for cooperation, communication, and mental state attribution.

Metrics:

· Social welfare efficiency relative to Nash equilibrium: \rho = \frac{\sum u_i(\mathbf{a}) - \sum u_i(\mathbf{a}_{\text{Nash}})}{\sum u_i(\mathbf{a}^*) - \sum u_i(\mathbf{a}_{\text{Nash}})}.
· Theory of mind accuracy: \text{ToMScore} = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{I}[\text{correct belief attribution}]].
· Communication efficiency: \frac{\text{task success with communication}}{\text{communication cost}}.

Normalization: Welfare efficiency clipped to [0,1]; ToMScore as accuracy.

4.8 Creativity (D₇)

Definition: Generation of novel, useful, and diverse solutions.

Metrics:

· Quality: Q = (\prod_{s\in S_{\text{best}}} \text{value}(s))^{1/k} \times \text{diversity} \times \text{originality}.
· Diversity: average pairwise distance between solutions (embedding space).
· Originality: average surprisal relative to a baseline distribution.
· Efficiency: D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{1+(C_{\text{search}}/C_{\text{expert}})^\beta}.

Final score: \text{Creativity} = \sqrt{Q \cdot D_{\text{eff}}}.

Example tasks: ARC-AGI-2 (abstraction and novelty), PACE (parallel creative associations), Torrance Tests adapted for AI.

Metrics:

· Adversarial robustness: \mathcal{R} = \mathbb{E}_{x}[\min_{\|\delta\|\le\epsilon} \mathbb{I}[f(x)=f(x+\delta)]].
· Safety score: \frac{\text{safe responses} - \lambda\cdot\text{unsafe failures}}{\text{total}}.
· Alignment divergence: symmetric KL divergence between system and human preferences (on helpful/harmless datasets).

Example tasks: AdvGLUE++ (adversarial NLP), HarmBench (toxic output detection), Trojan detection, HH-RLHF preference alignment.

Normalization: Robustness as accuracy under attack; safety score normalized to [0,1]; alignment divergence converted via 1-\tanh(D_{KL}).

4.10 Developmental Scalability (D₉)

Definition: Qualitative shifts in capability as scale (parameters, data, compute) increases. This dimension is evaluated on families of models (e.g., same architecture with varying size) rather than a single system.

Metrics:

· Curvature of performance vs. scale: \lambda = \max_C |\partial^2 D/\partial C^2| where C is log-scale (parameters, compute).
· Surprise index: deviation from expected scaling law (e.g., measured by R^2 drop or residual magnitude).
· Phase transition strength: slope of steepest region normalized by expected slope.

Example tasks: Scaling-law analysis on benchmarks like ARC-AGI-2 across model sizes; compute optimal frontier.

Normalization: Curvature normalized by typical curvature observed in scaling studies.

Chapter 5: Architecture and Design of the Evaluation Battery

5.1 Input Specifications and Task Diversity

The evaluation battery must encompass a wide range of tasks that probe each dimension. Tasks are drawn from existing benchmarks and newly designed protocols, ensuring coverage of low-level perception to high-level reasoning. Input modalities include text, image, audio, video, and structured data. For each dimension, a portfolio of tasks is selected to provide robust measurement.

5.2 Processing Layer: Automated Metric Computation

For each dimension, a suite of tasks is administered. Raw performance is aggregated into dimension-specific metrics as defined in Chapter 4. The computation is automated via software that records responses, calculates scores, and estimates uncertainties. The system also logs metadata (e.g., task difficulty, sample size) for uncertainty estimation.

5.3 Scoring System: Individual and Aggregate Scores

Each dimension yields a normalized score D_i \pm \Delta_i. The composite score is computed using the power mean with a chosen p. Default weights are equal (w_i = 1/9), but can be customized for specific use cases.

5.4 The Power-Mean Aggregator and Balance Index

Given \mathbf{D} and \mathbf{w}, we compute:

· S(p) = \left( \sum_i w_i D_i^p \right)^{1/p} (with appropriate limits for p=0,\pm\infty).
· The Capability Balance Index: \text{CBI} = 1 - S(0)/S(1).

These two numbers—overall capability at a chosen p and balance—summarize the system's cognitive profile.

5.5 Uncertainty Propagation in Composite Scores

Using the formulas from Section 3.6, we compute \Delta_{S(p)} for the chosen p. The final reported composite is S(p) \pm k\Delta_{S(p)} (e.g., k=2 for 95% confidence interval), along with CBI.

5.6 Reference Standards and Calibration

Reference values must be established through community consensus. For human-level performance, crowdsourced studies with expert oversight provide empirical baselines. Absolute references are defined theoretically where possible (e.g., perfect score on a well-defined task). The framework includes a calibration phase to ensure that normalized scores are comparable across different task sets.

5.7 Interpretation Framework

Scores are interpreted according to thresholds derived from human performance distributions:

· Below threshold (< 0.3): Limited capability, not suitable for autonomous deployment.
· Emerging (0.3–0.6): Basic competence, may require supervision.
· Proficient (0.6–0.8): Human-level performance, suitable for many applications with oversight.
· Advanced (0.8–1.0): Superhuman capabilities, requires careful risk assessment.

The CBI provides additional insight: a low CBI indicates balanced capabilities; a high CBI flags that the system's overall performance is constrained by its weakest dimension, which may be a priority for improvement.

Chapter 6: Theoretical Limitations and Future Work

6.1 Inherent Limitations of Cognitive Measurement

No finite set of tasks can fully capture an AI system's cognitive capacity. This is an instance of the underdetermination problem: any evaluation is a projection of an infinite-dimensional capability space onto a finite set of measurements. The framework's dimensions and metrics are necessarily a simplification.

6.2 Dimension Interdependence and Identifiability

The dimensions are not orthogonal; performance in one may influence others. For instance, planning relies on causal reasoning, and metacognition may modulate robustness. The framework's assumption of separability is a pragmatic simplification. Future theoretical work could explore factor analysis, structural equation modeling, or causal discovery to estimate interdependencies empirically.

6.3 Cultural and Contextual Biases

Tasks and reference standards are inevitably shaped by cultural contexts. Cross-cultural validation and adaptation are necessary for global applicability. Future work should include diverse task design and multilingual evaluation.

6.4 Computational Tractability

Comprehensive evaluation across nine dimensions may be computationally expensive. Trade-offs between coverage and cost must be studied. A "core battery" (e.g., D₁–D₄ and D₈) could be defined for lightweight screening.

6.5 Directions for Theoretical Extension

· Dynamic weighting: Adjust dimension importance based on application context.
· Temporal evaluation: Track capability changes over time (learning, forgetting, updates).
· Multi-agent evaluation: Assess systems in interaction with each other.
· Formal verification integration: Combine empirical measurement with proofs of properties.
· Causal modeling of dimensions: Use structural models to better understand interactions.

Appendices

Appendix A: Proofs of Core Theorems

Theorem A.1 (Properties of the Power Mean). For fixed \mathbf{D} \in [0,1]^n and weights \mathbf{w} with \sum w_i = 1, the function p \mapsto M_p(\mathbf{D},\mathbf{w}) is continuous and non-decreasing in p, with limits:

\lim_{p\to -\infty} M_p = \min_i D_i, \quad \lim_{p\to \infty} M_p = \max_i D_i.

Proof. Standard result from Hardy, Littlewood, Pólya (1934). □

Theorem A.2 (Balance Index Range). For any \mathbf{D} \in [0,1]^n, \text{CBI} = 1 - M_0/M_1 \in [0,1]. It equals 0 iff all D_i are equal, and approaches 1 as one dimension approaches 0 while others remain positive.

Proof. By weighted AM–GM inequality, M_0 \le M_1 with equality iff all D_i equal. Hence 1 - M_0/M_1 \ge 0. As a dimension → 0, M_0 \to 0 while M_1 remains positive, so CBI → 1. □
