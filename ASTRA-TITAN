II. MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICS FOUNDATION

2.1 Stability & Control Mathematics

2.1.1 Combustion Instability (Pogo) Analysis
The AI must solve coupled acoustic-structural equations to prevent resonant destruction.

· Governing Wave Equation (Simplified 1D):
  (1/c²) * (∂²p'/∂t²) = ∇²p' + β * (∂p'/∂t) + S(x,t)
  · p': Pressure perturbation from mean chamber pressure.
  · c: Speed of sound in the combustor medium.
  · β: Damping coefficient (modeled from injector design).
  · S(x,t): Energy source term from unsteady heat release.
· AI Implementation: Real-time spectral analysis of pressure transducer arrays (≥10 per engine) to identify growing acoustic modes (e.g., 1T, 1L) and apply pre-emptive injector modulation or pulsed throttling to disrupt coherence.

2.1.2 Engine-Out Contingency & Thrust Vector Control (TVC)
Upon failure of engine k, the AI must solve a constrained optimization problem in <10ms to rebalance forces and moments.

· Objective Function (Minimize Deviation):
  Minimize: Σᵢ (θᵢ - θᵢ₀)² + Σⱼ (Tⱼ - Tⱼ₀)² for all gimbaled engines i and throttled engines j.
· Constraints (Equilibrium Equations):
  1. Force Balance: Σⁿ Tₙ * sin(θₙ) ≈ 0 and Σⁿ Tₙ * cos(θₙ) ≈ F_desired
  2. Moment Balance: Σⁿ (rₙ × (Tₙ * sin(θₙ))) + M_aero ≈ 0
     · Tₙ: Thrust vector of n-th engine.
     · θₙ: Gimbal angle of n-th engine.
     · rₙ: Position vector of n-th engine from CoG.
     · M_aero: Aerodynamic moment.
· Solution Method: Quadratic Programming (QP) solver running on dedicated hardware per cluster AI.

2.1.3 Structural Load & Bending Moments
The vehicle's slenderness ratio λ = L / D ≈ 16.7 necessitates active bending mitigation.

· Bending Moment at Base: M_base = ∫₀ᴸ F_aero(z) * z dz + Σ (rₙ × F_thrustₙ)
  · F_aero(z): Distributed aerodynamic force (from q∞ dynamic pressure profile).
· AI Structural Control: The Level 2 Vehicle Dynamics AI uses a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) of the vehicle's flexural modes. It commands differential gimbal angles on outboard engines to apply a counter-moment M_control such that |M_net| < M_yield of the primary structure.

2.2 Propulsion & Trajectory Mathematics

2.2.1 Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation & Staging Logic

· Core Equation: Δv = Isp * g₀ * ln(m₀ / m_f)
  · For SSTO: m₀ = 84,000t, m_f = 6,000t + payload. With Isp_vac~380s, available Δv confirms LEO capability.
· Throttle Profile Optimization: AI (Level 3) solves a boundary value problem using indirect methods (Pontryagin's Maximum Principle) to define throttle schedule T(t) that minimizes m_propellant subject to max Q (dynamic pressure) and g-force constraints.

2.2.2 Convective & Radiative Heat Flux

· Stagnation Point Heat Flux (Sutton-Graves): q̇ = k √(ρ/r_n) V³
  · Used to define Thermal Protection System (TPS) thickness requirements. For peak re-entry (if reusable), q̇ exceeds 2 MW/m², necessitating ablative or transpiration cooling.
