Abstract

This dissertation presents the Metacognitive Operating System (MCOS)—a comprehensive cognitive architecture enabling a robot to land on any planetary body and, within hours, learn the local physics well enough to explore safely for decades. The MCOS unifies low-level actuation, online world modeling, scientific hypothesis testing, and multi-robot collaboration into a single mathematical framework. Key contributions include: (1) a Unified Force‑Space that decouples cognition from hardware morphology; (2) a VQ‑VAE proprioceptive tokenizer with online sim‑to‑real adaptation; (3) a contrastive hypothesis engine that treats prediction errors as scientific experiments; (4) a dynamic risk budget that balances curiosity and safety; (5) a three‑tier compute architecture hardened for space environments; (6) a delay‑tolerant collective intelligence protocol with spatial awareness; and (7) a comprehensive validation methodology for benchmarking autonomous physics learning. The MCOS transforms a robot from a pre‑programmed tool into an autonomous scientist capable of peer‑level collaboration with human explorers. An illustrative scenario of a landing on asteroid Kamoʻoalewa demonstrates the system's reasoning in the first 60 seconds of operation, and a detailed experimental design chapter lays out a path for empirical validation.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 The Challenge of Interplanetary Autonomy

Robotic exploration of the solar system has relied on a tedious cycle: orbiters map, rovers follow pre‑planned commands, and scientists wait months for each new instruction. The Mars rovers, for all their success, cover only a few kilometers per year because every move must be vetted by ground control. The latency to Mars is 3–24 minutes; to Europa, 35–90 minutes; to the outer planets, hours. This latency barrier makes real‑time teleoperation impossible and severely limits scientific return.

The only solution is full autonomy—a robot that can land, explore, and make scientific decisions without human intervention. But autonomy in an unknown world requires something deeper than today’s machine learning: it requires the ability to learn the physics of that world from scratch. A robot must become its own physicist, using its body as a laboratory instrument to infer gravity, friction, material properties, and dynamics—all while ensuring its own survival.

Current state-of-the-art robotic autonomy, exemplified by NASA's Mars rovers, operates within well-characterized environments and relies on human-provided models. These systems can prioritize targets and avoid obstacles, but they cannot adapt to fundamentally new physics. If a rover were dropped on an asteroid with microgravity, its pre-trained locomotion controllers would fail catastrophically. The rover would have no mechanism to diagnose why it is floating away and no way to invent a new gait.

The need for such capability is urgent. Upcoming missions to ocean worlds (Europa, Enceladus), asteroids (Psyche), and Titan demand robots that can operate in environments where gravity, terrain, and atmospheric conditions are poorly understood before arrival. The latency to these destinations precludes ground-in-the-loop control. The robots must be self-sufficient.

1.2 Thesis Statement

A robot equipped with a metacognitive operating system that unifies low‑level force control, online world modeling, active hypothesis testing, and collaborative learning can achieve indefinite autonomous operation on any planetary surface, learning local physics through safe experimentation and communicating discoveries as a peer scientist.

1.3 Contributions

This dissertation makes the following novel contributions:

1. Unified Force‑Space (UFS): A hardware‑agnostic action representation that enables the same cognitive core to control any robot morphology.
2. VQ‑VAE with Online Adaptation: A tokenizer that compresses raw sensor streams into discrete physics concepts and continuously aligns simulation‑trained codebooks to real sensor data via a learnable transformation and contrastive loss.

4. Dynamic Risk Budget: A mathematical framework that adjusts safety thresholds based on information gain potential and mission phase, preventing paralysis while ensuring survival.
5. Three‑Tier Compute Architecture: A radiation‑hardened, fail‑operative hardware stack that separates deterministic safety, real‑time control, and heavy cognitive processing.
6. Delay‑Tolerant Collective Intelligence with Spatial Awareness: A protocol for asynchronous sharing of learned physics modules across a fleet, with conflict resolution based on timestamps, confidence, and spatial metadata.

Chapter 2: Related Work

2.1 Robotic World Models

Recent advances in model‑based reinforcement learning (e.g., DreamerV3 [Hafner et al.], DayDreamer [Wu et al.]) have shown that agents can learn predictive models of their environment from pixels and proprioception. DreamerV3, for instance, learns a latent dynamics model and uses it for planning, achieving impressive results across diverse domains. However, these models are typically trained for a single environment and do not adapt online to radically different physics. When the gravity changes, the model must be retrained from scratch, which is sample-inefficient and risks catastrophic forgetting.

World models based on neural networks are also opaque: when a prediction fails, it is difficult to determine whether the cause is a change in gravity, friction, or sensor bias. This lack of interpretability is unacceptable for safety-critical space missions.

2.2 Lifelong Learning in Robotics

Lifelong learning aims to accumulate knowledge across tasks without forgetting. Elastic weight consolidation [Kirkpatrick et al.] and progressive neural networks [Rusu et al.] address catastrophic forgetting by protecting important weights or adding new columns for new tasks. These methods assume a stationary data distribution within each task and require task boundaries to be known. They do not handle sudden shifts in fundamental physics (e.g., gravity change) that occur without warning, nor do they provide a mechanism for active hypothesis testing to disambiguate the cause of the shift.

2.3 Space Robotics and Autonomous Systems

NASA’s Autonomous Sciencecraft [Chien et al.] and the Mars 2020 rover’s AEGIS system [Francis et al.] demonstrate onboard targeting and prioritization. These systems can identify interesting geological features and point instruments without human intervention. However, they operate within well‑characterized environments and rely on human‑provided models of terrain and science goals. No existing system can autonomously discover and model novel physics. The closest relative is the "self-aware" rover concept [Fong et al.], which monitors its own health, but it does not learn environmental physics.

2.4 Sim‑to‑Real Transfer

Sim‑to‑real gap is a central challenge. Approaches include domain randomization [Tobin et al.], system identification [Yu et al.], and online adaptation [Peng et al.]. Domain randomization trains a policy over a distribution of dynamics parameters, hoping that the real world falls within that distribution. System identification estimates parameters online and adapts the controller. The proposed VQ‑VAE with online adaptation builds on these ideas but introduces a discrete token space for cross‑environment generalization. Unlike continuous adaptation methods that may drift, the discrete codebook provides stable anchors that can be linearly transformed to match new sensor distributions.

2.5 Multi‑Robot Coordination under Delay

Delay‑tolerant networking (DTN) [Burleigh et al.] is the standard for deep‑space communication. It handles long delays and intermittent connectivity by store-and-forward mechanisms. The collective intelligence protocol adapts DTN principles to the exchange of learned physics models. However, existing work on multi-robot coordination assumes reliable communication or short delays. This dissertation introduces a merge protocol that accounts for spatial uncertainty and confidence, enabling robots to build a shared understanding of an unknown world despite hours of communication latency.

2.6 Limitations of Current Approaches for Extreme Autonomy

To motivate the MCOS, we summarize the key limitations of existing methods:

1. Sample Inefficiency: Deep RL methods require millions of interactions. A rover on Mars cannot afford to take millions of steps to learn that gravity is 3.7 m/s².
2. Catastrophic Forgetting: Fine-tuning a neural network on a new planet erases knowledge of Earth physics, which may be needed for comparison or if the robot returns to a known area.
3. Opaque Failure Modes: When a rover gets stuck, we cannot query its neural network for the reason. Was it a loss of traction? A software bug? A change in soil properties?
4. Lack of Causal Reasoning: Correlation is not physics. A neural network may learn that "when wheels spin, forward progress stops," but it cannot infer that the cause is low friction and that a different gait might succeed.
5. No Active Experimentation: Current robots are passive observers. They do not design experiments to disambiguate hypotheses, such as dropping a pebble to measure gravity.

The MCOS directly addresses these limitations by combining explicit parametric models with neural networks, using active hypothesis testing, and maintaining interpretable representations.

Chapter 3: Theoretical Foundations

3.1 Physics as a Learnable Latent Space

The interaction of a robot with its environment is governed by physical laws. These can be expressed as a set of parameters: gravity vector g, friction coefficients μₛ, μₖ, ground stiffness κ, damping c, masses mᵢ, etc. Learning physics means inferring these parameters from sensor data. The robot's observations (accelerometer, gyroscope, joint encoders, tactile sensors) are functions of these parameters and its own actions.

Formally, let the true state of the world be described by a vector φ ∈ ℝᵈ. At time t, the robot takes an action aₜ and receives an observation oₜ. The observation is generated by a function oₜ = h(φ, aₜ, ηₜ) where ηₜ is noise. The goal is to maintain a belief distribution p(φ | o₁...ₜ, a₁...ₜ) and use it for planning.

3.2 Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ‑VAE)

VQ‑VAEs [van den Oord et al.] learn a discrete codebook of latent representations. Given an input x, an encoder produces a continuous representation zₑ, which is mapped to the nearest codebook vector cₖ. The decoder reconstructs x from cₖ. The codebook is trained with a commitment loss. VQ‑VAEs are used here to tokenize continuous sensor streams into discrete physics concepts. The discrete nature is crucial: it allows the robot to maintain a finite set of "physics symbols" (e.g., "slipping," "rigid contact," "elastic deformation") that can be composed and reasoned about symbolically.

3.3 Bayesian Inference for Physical Parameters

Bayesian inference provides a principled way to update beliefs about parameters given observations. For a parameter θ with prior p(θ) and likelihood p(data|θ), the posterior is p(θ|data) ∝ p(data|θ) p(θ). For many physical parameters, conjugate priors allow closed‑form updates (e.g., Gaussian for linear models, Gamma for precision). For nonlinear cases, particle filters or ensemble methods are used. The MCOS maintains a parametric model with a full covariance matrix Σ representing uncertainty. This uncertainty drives exploration and risk assessment.

3.4 Planning under Uncertainty

Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) formalize decision‑making with uncertain state estimates. Solving a POMDP exactly is intractable for high-dimensional continuous spaces. The MCOS uses a simplified approach: a world model predicts future states, and uncertainty is propagated through the parametric model. Actions are evaluated by expected information gain and survival probability. This is similar to Bayesian reinforcement learning but with a structured representation.

3.5 Hysteresis and Safe Control

Hysteresis is a well‑known technique to prevent chattering in control systems. A Schmitt trigger uses different thresholds for activation and deactivation. In safety-critical systems, hysteresis timers prevent the system from oscillating between modes due to sensor noise. This is formalized as a finite state machine with time‑based guards. The MCOS's hardware-safety FSM implements such machines for critical variables (e.g., tip-over risk, power low).

3.6 Fisher Information and Optimal Experimental Design

The Fisher information matrix I(φ) measures the amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter φ. For a measurement model z = h(φ) + noise, the Fisher information is I(φ) = Hᵀ R⁻¹ H, where H = ∂h/∂φ and R is the measurement noise covariance. The Cramér-Rao bound states that the covariance of any unbiased estimator is at least the inverse of I(φ). Optimal experimental design seeks actions that maximize some scalar function of I(φ), such as the determinant (D-optimality) or trace (A-optimality). The MCOS uses D-optimality to select probing actions that most reduce uncertainty.

4.2 Layer 1: Hardware Abstraction and Proprioceptive Tokenization

Unified Force‑Space (UFS): The robot’s cognitive core never sees joint angles or motor currents. Instead, it issues commands in a physics‑first vocabulary:

· APPLY_FORCE(F, P, Δt): Apply force vector F at point P for duration Δt.
· RESTRICT_DOF(axis, stiffness): Make a degree of freedom passively compliant or stiff.
· SENSE_PROPERTY(property, location): Query a sensor (e.g., temperature, tactile pressure) at a location.
· RELEASE_CONTACT(): Break contact with the environment.

These commands are translated by the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) into joint‑level commands using a Body Morph Mapping that adapts to the current robot morphology. The mapping is learned via self-supervised exploration during a "body-swapping" curriculum: the robot explores in simulation with random morphologies and actions, collecting tuples (a, morph, j_cmds). A neural network is trained to predict j_cmds from (a, morph). This network becomes the mapping function Φ: A × Morphology → JointCommands.

Proprioceptive Tokenizer: Raw sensor streams (1 kHz torque, 100 Hz tactile, 100 Hz joint angles) are fed into a VQ‑VAE that outputs discrete token IDs. These tokens represent semantic concepts such as “elastic resistance” or “slipping.” The tokenizer includes an online adaptation head that aligns simulation‑trained codebooks to real sensor data via a learned linear transformation (Section 5.2). When the residual between the transformed latent and the nearest codebook exceeds a threshold, a provisional token is created and a probing action is triggered to characterize the novel sensation.

4.3 Layer 2: Online World Model and Hypothesis Engine

The World Model is a hybrid system:

· A neural network (transformer‑based) predicts next states from current state and action, trained via gradient descent. This model captures complex, non-parametric dynamics (e.g., granular media flow).
· A parametric physics model maintains explicit parameters φ (gravity, friction, etc.) with uncertainty Σ, updated via Bayesian inference. This model is interpretable and provides causal structure.

When the prediction error Δ exceeds a threshold, the Contrastive Hypothesis Engine is triggered. It generates competing hypotheses (e.g., “gravity changed” vs. “friction changed”), selects a probing action from the library (Section 5.4) to disambiguate, executes it safely, and updates the parametric model. The neural model is updated on a slower cycle (every few minutes) using a replay buffer that includes data from multiple environments, with elastic weight consolidation to prevent forgetting.

4.4 Layer 3: Multi‑Scale Planner and Hardware-Safety FSM

Planning Hierarchy:

· Reflex (ms–s): Balance, grip (bypasses world model, runs on Tier 2).
· Tactical (s–min): Gait selection, manipulation.
· Strategic (min–hrs): Exploration routes, experiment sequences.
· Meta (hrs–days): Curiosity‑driven goal selection.

Imagination‑Augmented Reality (IAR): Before any strategic action, the planner runs N internal simulations (N adjustable based on power budget) in the world model, including adversarial variations of uncertain parameters. Action is approved only if survival probability > 1 − Risk_Budget (Section 5.5).

Hardware-Safety FSM with Hysteresis: A deterministic, hardware-implemented finite state machine monitors critical variables (e.g., pitch angle, wheel slip, battery voltage). Each safety condition is a three‑state machine: NOMINAL → WARNING → EMERGENCY. Transitions have hysteresis timers (e.g., must be in WARNING for 100 ms before moving to EMERGENCY) to prevent noise-induced triggers. This layer can override the cognitive layers and issue emergency commands (e.g., stop motors, deploy anchor). It is implemented on Tier 1 (FPGA) for guaranteed response.

4.5 Layer 4: Curiosity Driver

The robot’s intrinsic motivation is to maximize:

```
Curiosity_Value(a) = E[IG(a)] × (1 - Risk_Budget(a))
```

where IG(a) is expected information gain (reduction in entropy of parametric model). The driver selects actions that maximize this product, subject to feasibility. This ensures the robot explores regions of high uncertainty but avoids actions that could destroy it.

4.6 Layer 5: Scientific Abstractor and Collective Intelligence

Scientific Abstractor: Every significant discovery is packaged into a structured report (JSON) containing hypothesis, confidence, evidence, and proposed next steps. Reports are transmitted to Earth and to other robots.

Collective Intelligence Protocol: Robots exchange compressed physics modules asynchronously. Each module includes:

· Parameters θ
· Covariance Σ
· Timestamp τ
· Region descriptor ρ (a spatial representation, e.g., a Gaussian mixture model over coordinates or a set of visual landmarks)
· Confidence σ (trace of Σ)

When two robots meet (or a communication window opens), they exchange lists of modules. For overlapping regions, a merge rule applies (see Section 5.8). No robot blocks; merges happen asynchronously.

4.7 Three‑Tier Compute Implementation

· Tier 1 (FPGA, radiation‑hardened): Hardware-Safety FSM only. Latency <1μs, power <1W. Runs independently.
· Tier 2 (RAD5545 microcontroller): Real‑time control: tokenization, parametric model updates, reflex planning. RTOS, memory protected, 5W.
· Tier 3 (hardened GPU/NPU): Cognitive layer: neural world model, imagination simulations, hypothesis generation. 30W, can be throttled or powered down.

Tier 3 failure degrades to Tier 2+1 operation (stable stance, pre‑planned sequences). Tier 2 failure triggers safe hibernation with Tier 1 beacon.

4.8 Illustrative Scenario: Landing on Asteroid Kamoʻoalewa

To ground the architecture, consider a robot landing on asteroid 469219 Kamoʻoalewa. The signal delay to Earth is 40 seconds; the robot is entirely on its own. The following timeline demonstrates the MCOS in action during the first 60 seconds.

T‑0s: Impact (Touchdown Event)

· Sensor Input: Accelerometers spike to 15g. High‑frequency vibration detected through the chassis.
· Layer 1 (HAL): Reports CONTACT_PROBABILITY: 1.0 on all four landing struts.
· Layer 2 (World Model): Prediction error Δ is critical. Pre‑trained "Earth gravity" model expects the robot to settle in 0.5s. Instead, the robot bounces back into the vacuum at 0.2 m/s.
· Action: Layer 3 (Hardware-Safety FSM) triggers: IMMEDIATE THRUSTER BURST (Downward) to prevent drifting into deep space.

T+10s: The First Hypothesis (SDM Triggered)

· Metacognitive State: World Model is "confused." It expected a 100 kg robot to stay down.
· Hypothesis Generation (Algorithm 1, see Section 5.9):
  · H₁: Gravity is ≈ 1/1000 of Earth.
  · H₂: Surface is "elastic/trampoline‑like."
  · H₃: Landing gear springs are malfunctioning.
· Probing Action Selected: "The Static Press." The robot pushes its manipulator arm slowly against the ground with a constant 50 N force while measuring the displacement of its own body.

T+30s: Physics Convergence

· Observation: As the arm pushes down, the robot's body rises upward with linear acceleration a = F/m.
· Calculated Value: The robot computes local g by subtracting the predicted thrust‑induced acceleration from the total observed motion.
· Result: g ≈ 0.005 m/s².
· World Model Update: The VQ‑VAE Tokenizer creates a new "Micro‑Gravity" context. The adaptation matrix W shifts. The robot now "understands" that every step must be a "grip‑and‑pull" rather than a "weighted step."

T+45s: Goal Invention (Layer 4)

· Curiosity Drive: Uncertainty is high regarding "Surface Cohesion."
· Goal: "Can I move 2 m without losing contact with the surface?"
· Imagination (IAR): Runs 1,000 simulations. 995 show the robot floating away if it walks like a human; 5 show success using "Magnetic/Talon Grip" mode.
· Decision: Deploy titanium micro‑spines into the regolith.

T+60s: The First Scientific Abstract (Layer 5)

· Uplink Transmission:

```json
{
  "insight": "Surface is non-elastic, gravity is 0.0005g",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "evidence": ["Static Press Test Δz/Δt matched m=150kg", "No seismic damping detected"],
  "protocol_shift": "Switching to Tethered/Spine Locomotion",
  "status": "Exploring North Crater. Uncertainty 12%."
}
```

Outcome: In 60 seconds, the robot calibrated itself to an entirely new physical regime and rewrote its locomotion strategy before taking its second step.

Chapter 5: Mathematical Formulations

5.1 Unified Latent Action Space

Define the action space A ⊂ ℝ⁷ × ℝ³ × ℝ⁺ for APPLY_FORCE(F, P, Δt), with additional discrete commands. The HAL implements a function:

```
Φ: A × Morphology → JointCommands
```

where Morphology is a kinematic tree description (list of links, joints, actuators). Φ is learned via self‑supervised exploration during the body‑swapping curriculum. Specifically, the robot explores in simulation with random morphologies and actions, collecting tuples (a, morph, j_cmds). A neural network is trained to predict j_cmds from (a, morph). This network becomes the mapping function.

5.2 VQ‑VAE with Online Adaptation

Let xₜ ∈ ℝᵈ be the raw sensor vector at time t. The encoder E produces a continuous latent zₑ = E(xₜ). The online adaptation head applies a learned linear transformation W (initialized as identity):

```
z̃ₑ = W zₑ
```

Quantization selects the nearest codebook vector c ∈ C:

```
z_q = argmin_{c∈C} ||z̃ₑ - c||₂
```

Decoder D reconstructs x̂ₜ = D(z_q). The loss is:

```
L = ||xₜ - x̂ₜ||₂² + ||sg[z̃ₑ] - z_q||₂² + β ||z̃ₑ - sg[z_q]||₂²
```

where sg is stop‑gradient. The first term is reconstruction loss, the second moves codebook vectors towards encoder outputs, and the third (commitment loss) encourages encoder outputs to stay close to codebook.

W is updated via a contrastive loss that pulls temporally close sensor readings together in the transformed space. Specifically, define a set of positive pairs (t, t+δ) where δ is small (e.g., within 0.1s). Negative pairs are random. The contrastive loss is:

```
L_cont = -log( exp(sim(z̃ₑ(t), z̃ₑ(t+δ))/τ) / Σ_{j≠t} exp(sim(z̃ₑ(t), z̃ₑ(j))/τ) )
```

This encourages W to produce a representation where nearby times are similar, which helps adapt to new sensor distributions while preserving temporal coherence. W is updated slowly (e.g., with learning rate 1e-4) to avoid destabilizing the codebook.

When residual r = ||z̃ₑ - z_q||₂ > r_thresh, a provisional token is created (a new codebook entry is initialized) and a probing action is triggered to characterize the novel sensation. The new codebook entry is added to C, and the codebook size grows as the robot encounters new phenomena. To prevent unbounded growth, codebook entries that are rarely used are pruned.

5.3 Hybrid Bayesian‑Neural World Model

Neural model: f_θ(s, a) → s', trained via predictive loss L_pred = ||s' - s'_true||². The neural model is a transformer that takes a history of states and actions and predicts the next state. It is trained on a replay buffer that stores experiences from all environments, with importance sampling to balance old and new data. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is used: a regularization term penalizes changes to weights that are important for previous tasks.

Parametric model: Maintains a vector φ = [g, μₛ, μₖ, κ, c, m₁,...,mₙ]ᵀ and covariance Σ. For linearizable relationships, a Kalman filter update after measurement z:

```
K = Σ Hᵀ (H Σ Hᵀ + R)⁻¹
φ_new = φ + K (z - H φ)
Σ_new = (I - K H) Σ
```

For nonlinear relationships (e.g., friction), a particle filter with N=50 particles is used. Each particle represents a possible φ, and weights are updated based on likelihood of observations.

Coupling between models: The neural model provides a residual prediction: s' = f_θ(s, a) + ε, where ε is a correction term learned from data. The parametric model provides a prior for φ, which influences the neural model's predictions via a differentiable physics layer. Specifically, the neural model can query the parametric model for expected accelerations given φ, and use that as a feature. The two models are trained jointly: the neural model minimizes prediction error while also being consistent with the parametric model's current φ. This is achieved by adding a regularization term L_phy = ||f_θ(s, a) - g_φ(s, a)||², where g_φ is the prediction from the parametric model.

5.4 Probing Action Library

Each probing action is defined by:

· A measurement function h(φ) that maps true parameters to expected sensor readings.
· A Jacobian H = ∂h/∂φ.
· A noise covariance R.
· A safety check: the action must have survival probability > 0.999 under current uncertainty.

Actions are selected to maximize the expected information gain, approximated by the reduction in the determinant of Σ (D‑optimality) or by the trace of the Fisher information matrix. The expected posterior covariance after taking action a and receiving measurement z is given by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound: Σ_post ≈ (Σ_prior⁻¹ + I(a))⁻¹, where I(a) is the Fisher information for action a. Thus, the information gain is det(Σ_prior) - det((Σ_prior⁻¹ + I(a))⁻¹). The robot computes I(a) for each candidate action using the current φ estimate and selects the action that maximizes this gain, subject to safety.

Example actions:

· Drop Test: Drop a small mass from a known height. h(φ) = g (gravity). H = [1, 0, ..., 0].
· Scratch Test: Drag a tool across the surface with controlled normal force, measuring tangential force. h(φ) = [μₖ, κ] (friction and stiffness). H is a 2×n matrix.
· Push Test: Apply a force and measure displacement. h relates to stiffness and damping.

The library is pre-populated with actions designed for common physical parameters, but new actions can be synthesized by the curiosity driver if existing ones are insufficient.

5.5 Dynamic Risk Budget

Risk budget R_budget for action a:

```
R_budget(a) = R_base · (1 + β·IG_norm(a)) · γ(phase)
```

where:

· R_base = 0.001 (99.9% survival baseline)
· IG_norm(a) ∈ [0,1] is expected information gain normalized by maximum possible gain (e.g., using a reference action)
· β = 2.0 (exploration factor)
· γ(phase): early exploration = 3.0, nominal = 1.0, critical = 0.3

Action approved if predicted survival probability ≥ 1 − R_budget(a). Survival probability is computed via Monte Carlo simulation in the world model, sampling from the current distribution over φ.

5.6 Resource State Vector and Cost Model

Resource State Vector:

```
RSV = [E, T₁,...,T_m, P_avail, C_cycles]
```

where E is energy remaining (J), Tᵢ are temperatures of critical components (°C), P_avail is available power (W), and C_cycles are remaining compute cycles (estimated based on CPU/GPU usage).

Each action has a cost vector ΔRSV. The planner maintains constraints:

· E(t) ≥ E_min (energy for survival)
· Tᵢ(t) ≤ T_max,i (thermal limits)
· Σ C_cycles ≤ available_cycles (compute budget)

If constraints cannot be met, the robot degrades to a lower‑power mode or hibernates. The planner uses a model predictive control (MPC) approach to select actions that maximize cumulative curiosity value while respecting constraints over a horizon.

5.7 Graceful Degradation via Capability Graphs

Define a directed acyclic graph G = (F, D) where F = functions (e.g., "walk", "manipulate", "communicate"), D = dependencies (component → function). When component j fails, all functions f with a path from j to f are disabled. The remaining capability set is:

```
F_remaining = { f ∈ F | ∀ components c in ancestors(f), c is functional }
```

The robot broadcasts this set and a recommended mission profile (e.g., "can only act as a static weather station").

5.8 Delay‑Tolerant Synchronization with Spatial Awareness

Each physics module M = (θ, Σ, τ, ρ, σ) is stored locally. ρ is a region descriptor, which can be:

· A Gaussian mixture model over coordinates (if GPS available) with mean and covariance.
· A set of visual landmarks (SIFT features) with their 3D positions, enabling relative localization.
· A bounding box in some metric space.

When two robots meet, they exchange lists of modules. For each pair of modules with overlapping regions (defined by a statistical test or landmark matching), a merge rule applies:

```
if |τ₁ - τ₂| < δτ and σ₁, σ₂ > 0.9:
    θ_merged = (Σ₁⁻¹ θ₁ + Σ₂⁻¹ θ₂) / (Σ₁⁻¹ + Σ₂⁻¹)
    Σ_merged = (Σ₁⁻¹ + Σ₂⁻¹)⁻¹
elif τ₁ ≫ τ₂: keep newer
elif σ₁ ≫ σ₂: keep higher confidence
else: flag for human review
```

No robot blocks; merges happen asynchronously. The merged module is stored with a new timestamp and a region that is the union (or intersection) of the original regions, depending on context.

5.9 Algorithm 1: Bayesian Hypothesis Disambiguation

This algorithm is the core of the Scientific Discovery Mode. It is triggered when the prediction error Δ exceeds the metacognitive threshold.

    - Generate Layer 5 Insight Report.
9.  RETURN θ_new, Σ_new
```

Mathematical Interpretation of the "Drop Test": When the robot drops a pebble to test gravity, it solves for a single variable while holding others constant. The observed acceleration a_obs deviates from expected g. The update to the gravity parameter is:

```
g_new = g_prior + K (a_obs - g_prior)
```

where K = σ_g² / (σ_g² + σ_meas²) is the Kalman gain, representing how much the robot trusts the new observation versus its prior. This is a direct application of Bayesian inference.

With Algorithm 1, the MCOS is no longer a "black box" neural network. It is a transparent, falsifiable system. If the robot makes a mistake, we can examine the hypothesis log and see exactly why it believed the asteroid's surface was "made of sponge" before correcting its model to "low‑gravity regolith."

5.10 The Proprioceptive Codebook: From Raw Volts to Physical Semantics

The VQ-VAE Proprioceptive Tokenizer (Section 5.2) serves as the bridge between high-frequency sensor noise and symbolic reasoning. This section details the "Proprioceptive Codebook"—a discrete library of K latent vectors that categorize the robot's physical state. Each token corresponds to a specific manifold in the Unified Force-Space (UFS). When the robot encounters a failure mode or novel physics, the encoder E(xₜ) generates a latent zₑ that drifts away from "nominal" tokens. The resulting reconstruction error triggers the Contrastive Hypothesis Engine.

5.10.1 Failure Mode Tokenization

The codebook is initialized through simulation-based pretraining across diverse environments, then adapted online. Table 5.1 defines the primary codebook entries used to identify and diagnose mechanical or environmental failures.

Table 5.1: Proprioceptive Codebook Entries for Failure Mode Detection

Token ID Semantic Label Proprioceptive Signature (Latent Space) Physical Interpretation
P_TOK_042 Vacuum High-Centering Low τ (torque), High ω (velocity), Zero Δz Wheels/legs spinning with no ground reaction force; indicates loss of traction in microgravity
P_TOK_118 Regolith Liquefaction Stochastic τ spikes, Increasing sinkage (z_pos) Surface particles behaving as a non-Newtonian fluid under shear stress
P_TOK_205 Cold-Weld Seizure Infinite I (current), Zero Δθ (joint angle) Metal-to-metal bonding in high vacuum; joint immobilized by adhesion
P_TOK_089 Elastic Recoil Phase-shifted F and v, Periodic z oscillation Surface restitution e > 0.8; indicates "bouncy" substrate with high energy return
P_TOK_312 Shear Failure Sudden τ drop during peak loading Soil structure collapsing under the robot's weight; bearing capacity exceeded
P_TOK_073 Viscous Drag Force proportional to velocity, No static friction Immersion in fluid or granular medium with significant damping
P_TOK_156 Brittle Fracture High-frequency acoustic emission, Sudden force drop Surface crust fracturing under load; indicates hollow or brittle substrate
P_TOK_221 Electrostatic Adhesion Non-contact force, Discharge spikes Dust adhesion or charging in low-gravity, high-radiation environments

5.10.2 Mapping Tokens to Material Properties

To transition from a discrete token to a continuous parameter estimate suitable for JSON serialization, the MCOS uses a learned mapping function Γ. For an observed token sequence S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ}, the estimate for a physical parameter θ is:

θ̂ = Γ(S) = Σᵢ wᵢ · fᵢ(sᵢ)

where fᵢ are per-token basis functions and wᵢ are learned weights. For example, the Regolith Shear Strength τ is derived by correlating the transition from P_TOK_042 (nominal traction) to P_TOK_312 (shear failure) against the normal force Fₙ applied at the moment of slip:

τ = c + σₙ tan(φ)

where σₙ = Fₙ/A is the normal stress, and (c, φ) are updated via Bayesian inference from multiple slip events.

5.10.3 The "Novelty" Token and Probing Trigger

If the VQ-VAE encounters a sensor stream xₜ where the residual r = ||W zₑ - z_q||₂ exceeds the 3σ threshold of all known codebook entries, the MCOS initializes a provisional token P_TOK_NEW. This acts as a placeholder while Algorithm 1 executes a probing action to characterize the novel phenomenon.

Case Study: The "Crisp" Surface (Psyche)

· Detection: Upon contact, the IMU detects high-frequency "crackling" vibrations never seen in Earth-simulated regolith.
· Tokenization: r > r_thresh; P_TOK_NEW is assigned with a timestamp and spatial location.
· Probing: The robot performs a "Micro-Tap" (action a_tap) with controlled force and measures acoustic response.
· Disambiguation: The high acoustic impedance (Z = ρ·v_sound ≈ 4.5×10⁷ Pa·s/m) suggests a metallic, brittle crust rather than granular regolith.
· Update: P_TOK_NEW is permanently renamed P_TOK_441: METALLIC_BRITTLE_CRUST and added to the local codebook. The new codebook entry is shared via the collective intelligence protocol.

5.10.4 Diagnostic State Machine with Hysteresis

To prevent "chattering" between failure tokens due to sensor noise, the MCOS applies a temporal hysteresis filter. A failure mode is only "committed" to the Scientific Abstract (Layer 5) if the token remains dominant for a duration λ proportional to the hardware tier's safety latency:

λ = λ_base · (1 + α · tier_factor)

where tier_factor = 1 for Tier 2, 10 for Tier 3. This ensures that transient anomalies (e.g., a single slip event) do not trigger full scientific reporting, while persistent phenomena do.

5.11 The Extended MCOS-JSON Schema for Polymorphic Scientific Reporting

Building on the tokenization layer, the Scientific Abstractor (Layer 5) packages discoveries into structured reports. The schema is polymorphic by design, containing a core set of "Universal Physics" keys and a conditional "Environment-Specific" metadata block. This ensures bandwidth efficiency: a robot on an airless rock like Psyche does not waste bits reporting zero atmospheric density, while a Titan explorer can prioritize fluid dynamics.

5.11.2 Specialized Metadata Modules

Depending on the environment_specific.type flag, the schema dynamically selects different high-fidelity physics parameter sets:

A. Vacuum / Regolith Bodies (e.g., Psyche, Kamoʻoalewa)
For airless worlds, the focus shifts to electrostatics and geotechnical stability:

· Dielectric Constant εᵣ: Critical for grounding safety and radar-based depth sounding
· Regolith Shear Strength τ: Defined via Mohr-Coulomb: τ = c + σₙ tan(φ)
· Porosity & Bulk Density: Essential for predicting sinkage and subsurface void collapse
· Electrostatic Potential: Monitors charging in plasma environment

B. Dense Atmosphere Worlds (e.g., Titan, Venus)
Here, the MCOS prioritizes aero-rheology:

· Reynolds Number Re: Categorizes flow regime (laminar vs. turbulent)
· Drag Coefficient C_d: Updated online as body configuration changes
· Specific Heat Ratio γ: Used for thermal management and acoustic ranging
· Wind Vector: 3D wind field with uncertainty
· Acoustic Impedance: For sound-based navigation and communication

C. Ocean Worlds / Cryo-Environments (e.g., Europa, Enceladus)
The schema shifts to phase-change physics:

· Brine Salinity: Affects conductivity and corrosion rates
· Ice Brittleness Index: A metacognitive trigger for "tread softly" gaits
· Sublimation Rate: For predicting mass loss in tools
· Thermal Diffusivity: Heat transport through ice shell

D. Granular/Rubble Pile (e.g., Bennu, Ryugu)
For loosely consolidated bodies:

· Angle of Repose: Maximum stable slope
· Flowability Index: How easily grains move under vibration
· Cohesion: Inter-particle bonding strength
· Size Distribution: Particle size statistics

5.11.3 Implementation Logic: The Context Switch

The Scientific Abstractor uses a lookup table to decide which parameters to include. If the VQ-VAE Tokenizer detects a "Fluid Drag" token (P_TOK_073) consistently for 60 seconds, it signals Layer 5 to activate the FLUID_ATMOSPHERE block. The decision is based on a Bayesian classifier over recent token sequences:

P(type | S) ∝ P(S | type) · P(type)

where the likelihood P(S | type) is learned from simulation and updated online.

Environment Type Priority Parameter 1 Priority Parameter 2 Trigger Token(s)
Solid Rocky Young's Modulus (E) Static Friction (μₛ) P_TOK_089 (elastic)
Granular Flowability (Φ) Angle of Repose P_TOK_118, P_TOK_312
Cryo-Slurry Viscosity (η) Thermal Diffusivity P_TOK_073 (viscous)
Vacuum Regolith Dielectric Constant Electrostatic Potential P_TOK_221 (electrostatic)
Atmosphere Drag Coefficient Wind Vector P_TOK_073 + pressure

5.12 The Imagination Safety Net: Adversarial Monte Carlo over Physical Tokens

The Imagination Safety Net (ISN) is the MCOS's final gatekeeper before high-stakes physical maneuvers. It transforms discrete tokens into an "Adversarial Simulation" environment that explores worst-case interpretations of current physical uncertainty. While Layer 2 predicts what should happen, the ISN explores what could go wrong.

5.12.1 Token-to-Simulation Mapping

When the Proprioceptive Tokenizer identifies a state (e.g., P_TOK_118: Regolith Liquefaction), the ISN instantiates a local physics sandbox using the parametric model (φ, Σ). Instead of a single "best guess" simulation, the ISN performs importance sampling from the tails of the covariance matrix Σ, specifically targeting the "Adversarial Manifold"—the set of physical parameters that are statistically plausible but mission-terminating.

5.12.2 The Adversarial Monte Carlo (AMC) Algorithm

For a proposed strategic action a_strat (e.g., "Climb 30° Crater Wall"), the ISN executes N internal simulations:

1. Sample Parameters: Draw φ_sim ~ N(φ, Σ) using importance weighting toward low-probability tails.
2. Inject Token-Specific Perturbations: If P_TOK_312 (Shear Failure) was recently active, bias φ_sim toward lower cohesion values c to stress-test the gait:
   c_sim = c_prior - α · σ_c · I(P_TOK_312)
   where α = 2.0 ensures 2σ stress test.
3. Run Trajectory: Simulate the robot's Body Morph Mapping over the local elevation map for horizon H.
4. Evaluate Survival: Check for terminal states (tip-over, high-center, joint over-torque, power exhaustion).
5. Compute Survival Probability: P_survive = (number of safe trajectories) / N

The action is only committed if P_survive ≥ 1 - R_budget(a_strat).

5.12.3 Handling the Imagination-Reality Gap

A critical failure mode of standard simulators is the "sim-to-real gap." MCOS mitigates this by tracking the Imagination-Reality Gap (IRG):

IRG = ||s_actual - s_imagined|| / σ_imagination

If the robot's actual trajectory deviates significantly from its internal "imagination" (IRG > 3), the ISN dynamically increases the Risk Budget multiplier γ(phase) (Section 5.5), effectively forcing the robot into a more conservative, "high-confidence" gait until the physics model converges.

5.12.4 Computational Throttling

Because Tier 3 (NPU) is power-intensive, the ISN uses a heuristic complexity trigger based on mission phase and uncertainty:

· Routine Action (walking on flat ground, Σ small): Run 10 simulations on Tier 2 (microcontroller).
· High-Stakes Action (traversing a 0.001g ledge, Σ large): Boot Tier 3 for 1,000+ adversarial simulations.
· Critical Maneuver (first step onto unknown terrain): Run 10,000 simulations with worst-case perturbations.

The compute cost is tracked in the Resource State Vector, and the planner may defer high-cost actions if power is low.

5.13 Complete Example: From Sensor to Scientific Insight

To illustrate the full pipeline, consider the Kamoʻoalewa scenario from Section 4.8, now traced through the mathematical layers:

1. Touchdown (t=0s): Raw accelerometer spikes → VQ-VAE encoder produces zₑ. Residual r large → provisional token created.
2. Tokenization (t=0.1s): Codebook lookup identifies closest match as P_TOK_NEW (novel physics).
3. Hypothesis Generation (t=1s): Algorithm 1 triggered. Three hypotheses instantiated with priors from Earth simulation.
4. Probing Action Selection (t=2s): D-optimality calculation selects "Static Press" (maximizes det(Σ_prior) - det(Σ_post)).
5. Execution (t=3-10s): Action executed with safety monitoring. Sensor stream X_test collected.
6. Tokenization of Test Data (t=11s): X_test mapped to tokens: [P_TOK_089, P_TOK_042, P_TOK_042].
7. Bayesian Update (t=12s): Kalman update reduces gravity uncertainty from 0.1 to 0.0001. Evidence strongly favors H₁ (gravity shift).
8. Codebook Update (t=13s): Novel token formalized as P_TOK_999: MICROGRAVITY_BOUNCE.
9. Scientific Abstract (t=14s): JSON generated with environment_specific.type = "VACUUM_REGOLITH", metadata including g=0.005 m/s².
10. Imagination Safety Net (t=15s): For proposed step, 1000 simulations run; 995 safe → action approved.
11. Collective Intelligence (t=60s): Module broadcast to any nearby robots via DTN.

This end-to-end trace demonstrates how the mathematical formulations of Chapter 5 unify to produce the intelligent behavior illustrated in Chapter 4.

Chapter 6: Experimental Design and Validation

This chapter proposes a comprehensive methodology to empirically validate the MCOS architecture. While the implementation and full-scale testing are beyond the scope of this theoretical dissertation, the following framework provides a blueprint for future work and establishes falsifiable claims.

6.1 The MCOS-Planets Benchmark Suite

We propose a new benchmark, MCOS-Planets, consisting of a set of simulated planetary environments with diverse and challenging physics. The benchmark is implemented in a high-fidelity physics engine (e.g., MuJoCo, Bullet, or Isaac Sim) with the ability to dynamically change gravity, friction, restitution, and other parameters during an episode. The environments include:

1. Earth-Like: 1g, moderate friction, solid ground. Baseline for transfer.
2. Micro-Gravity Asteroid: 0.001g, low friction, regolith with uncertain cohesion.
3. High-Gravity Super-Earth: 2g, high friction, rocky terrain.
4. Icy Moon: 0.1g, extremely low friction (ice), with crevasses.
5. Comet: 0.0001g, extremely low gravity, highly porous surface (low stiffness).
6. Titan: 0.14g, thick atmosphere (drag), methane mud (complex rheology).
7. Sensor Anomaly: Same as Earth-Like but with injected sensor bias (e.g., accelerometer offset) to test H₃.

Each environment provides a robot model (e.g., a quadruped with a manipulator arm) and a set of scientific goals (e.g., reach a waypoint, collect samples, measure subsurface properties). The robot must survive for a simulated mission duration (e.g., 100 hours) while maximizing scientific return.

6.2 Metrics

To evaluate performance, we define the following metrics:

· Time-to-Physics-Convergence (TPC): The time (or number of actions) required to estimate each physical parameter (g, μ, κ) within 5% of its true value, with 95% confidence. This measures the efficiency of active learning.
· Safe Exploration Rate (SER): The ratio of information gain (reduction in entropy) to the number of safety violations (e.g., falls, power depletion, thermal overload). A violation is defined as any event that would damage the robot in reality.
· Hypothesis Disambiguation Accuracy (HDA): For each anomaly event (Δ > threshold), the percentage of times the system correctly identifies the root cause (gravity vs. friction vs. sensor bias) as determined by ground truth. This tests Algorithm 1.
· Lifelong Retention Score (LRS): After being exposed to multiple environments in sequence, the robot's ability to recall the physics of a previously visited environment when returned to it. Measured by the error in parameter estimates upon return.
· Computational Cost: Average power consumption (simulated) and peak compute usage, broken down by tier.

6.3 Ablation Studies

To isolate the contributions of each component, we compare the full MCOS against several ablated versions:

· MCOS-Full: The complete architecture as described.
· NoHypothesis: MCOS without the contrastive hypothesis engine. The robot still has a hybrid world model but does not actively test hypotheses; it passively updates parameters via prediction error.
· NoCuriosity: MCOS without the curiosity driver. The robot follows a random or pre-programmed exploration policy.
· NoRiskBudget: MCOS with a fixed risk budget (R_budget = constant, no dynamic adjustment). This agent may be overly cautious or reckless.
· NeuralOnly: Only the neural world model (no parametric model, no hypothesis testing). This represents a state-of-the-art model-based RL agent (e.g., DreamerV3) continuously learning online.
· ParametricOnly: Only the parametric model with Bayesian updates (no neural model). This agent cannot capture complex dynamics like granular flow.

Each ablation is evaluated on the MCOS-Planets suite. We hypothesize that:

· MCOS-Full will have the lowest TPC and highest HDA.
· NoHypothesis will have slower convergence and may converge to wrong parameters because it cannot disambiguate causes.
· NoCuriosity will have low information gain and may fail to explore informative regions.
· NoRiskBudget may either be too risky (die early) or too cautious (stagnate) depending on the fixed threshold.
· NeuralOnly will suffer from catastrophic forgetting and slow adaptation.
· ParametricOnly will fail in environments with non-parametric dynamics (e.g., Titan mud).

6.4 Simulation Setup

We propose using a modified version of the Isaac Sim platform, which supports soft-body dynamics and granular media. The robot model is a quadruped with a 6-DOF arm, equipped with joint encoders, IMU, tactile sensors on feet and gripper, and a camera. The simulation runs at 1 kHz for control and 10 Hz for vision. Each experiment is repeated 10 times with different random seeds.

The robot's neural world model is a transformer with 10 million parameters, trained on a replay buffer of size 1 million transitions. The parametric model uses a particle filter with 100 particles. The probing action library contains 10 predefined actions (drop, scratch, push, twist, etc.). The risk budget parameters are tuned via grid search on a validation set (a subset of environments).

6.5 Expected Results

We anticipate that MCOS-Full will achieve TPC of under 10 minutes in all environments, compared to hours for NeuralOnly. HDA is expected to be above 95% for all anomalies. The SER will be highest for MCOS-Full because it balances curiosity and safety. Ablation studies will confirm the necessity of each component.

6.6 Discussion

The proposed experiments are designed to be reproducible and to provide strong evidence for the claims made in this dissertation. If successful, they would demonstrate that the MCOS is the first architecture capable of rapid online physics learning in extreme environments. The benchmark suite itself would be a contribution, providing a standard testbed for future research in autonomous space robotics.

Chapter 7: Conclusion

This dissertation has presented the Metacognitive Operating System, a complete cognitive architecture for autonomous interplanetary robots. By unifying force‑level control, online world modeling, active hypothesis testing, and collaborative learning, the MCOS enables a robot to land on any world and, within minutes, understand its physics well enough to explore safely for decades. The mathematical formulations provide a rigorous foundation for such a system, and the illustrative scenario on asteroid Kamoʻoalewa demonstrates the system's reasoning in real time.

The MCOS transforms robots from pre‑programmed tools into autonomous scientists—partners in the discovery of new worlds. The architecture is designed to be transparent and falsifiable; every decision can be traced back to hypotheses and evidence. The proposed validation framework in Chapter 6 lays out a clear path to empirically demonstrate these capabilities.

Future work will involve several extensions:

· Non‑parametric physics: Extending the parametric model to include non‑parametric components for complex material behaviors (e.g., granular flow, plasticity) using Gaussian processes or neural fields.
· Online codebook expansion: Implementing a more sophisticated mechanism for adding new tokens to the VQ-VAE codebook, possibly using a Bayesian non-parametric prior (e.g., Chinese restaurant process).
· Formal verification of the Hardware-Safety FSM: Using model checking to prove that the hysteresis-based safety layer never enters unsafe states under all possible sensor inputs.
· Hardware-in-the-loop testing: Building a physical prototype and testing in simulated low-gravity environments (parabolic flights) or on Earth with offloading.
· Multi-robot coordination under extreme latency: Extending the collective intelligence protocol to handle communication delays of hours and highly intermittent connectivity.

The next step is to implement the MCOS in simulation and run the proposed experiments. This dissertation provides the theoretical blueprint; the empirical validation will follow.
