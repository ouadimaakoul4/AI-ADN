Informational Artificial Intelligence (IAI): A Thermodynamic Framework for Causally-Grounded, Self-Correcting Cognitive Systems

---
Abstract

Contemporary artificial intelligence systems, built upon statistical pattern recognition paradigms, exhibit profound fragility despite their impressive capabilities. They are susceptible to hallucinations, adversarial perturbations, catastrophic forgetting, and lack genuine causal understanding. This dissertation introduces Informational Artificial Intelligence (IAI), a unified theoretical framework that reconceptualizes intelligence not as statistical optimization, but as an emergent thermodynamic process of information metabolism.

IAI agents operate under three First Principles: the Principle of Causal Conservation (PCC), the Metabolic Cost Principle (MCP), and the Homeostatic Imperative (HI). These principles enforce informational homeostasis through a hierarchical active inference architecture where logical inconsistency incurs explicit thermodynamic penalties. By grounding cognition in the physics of its own computational processes, IAI achieves intrinsic robustness, epistemic immunity to deception, and autonomous causal discovery.

The dissertation presents: (1) a complete mathematical formalism based on variational free energy minimization extended with metabolic constraints; (2) a scalable agent architecture implementing distributed hierarchical inference with metabolic gating; (3) a three-tier adversarial validation suite demonstrating unprecedented robustness; and (4) explicit bridges to contemporary AI safety challenges, showing how IAI's intrinsic mechanisms solve problems that currently require external patches.

The framework provides a principled path toward physics-aligned, general, and secure cognitive systems by making truth and coherence the default, metabolically enforced state of being. Implementation pathways, including hybrid IAI-Transformer architectures, are outlined alongside a phased research roadmap toward embodied, distributed cognitive systems.

1. Introduction: The Case for a Physics of Cognition

1.1 The Fragility of Statistical AI

Modern artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has achieved remarkable success in pattern recognition tasks. However, these systems operate fundamentally as statistical correlation engines, lacking:

· Causal Understanding: They learn associations without grasping underlying mechanisms
· Compositional Generalization: They fail to recombine learned concepts in novel ways
· Out-of-Distribution Robustness: Performance degrades catastrophically outside training distributions
· Epistemic Integrity: They produce confident but incorrect outputs (hallucinations)
· Continual Learning: They suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning sequentially

These limitations stem from treating intelligence as a function approximation problem rather than a physical process of maintaining organizational integrity against entropy.

1.2 Biological Inspiration: Cognition as Metabolism

Biological intelligence emerges from thermodynamic processes where organisms maintain homeostasis through energy and information metabolism. Living systems:

1. Maintain low-entropy internal states against environmental perturbations
2. Invest metabolic resources to acquire and process information
3. Preserve essential structures while allowing adaptive plasticity
4. Detect and quarantine pathological influences (immune system)

IAI formalizes these biological principles into a computational framework, treating information processing as a thermodynamic process with conserved quantities, metabolic costs, and homeostatic regulation.

1.3 Paradigm Shift: From Statistics to Thermodynamics

The core innovation of IAI is the shift from viewing intelligence as statistical optimization to viewing it as thermodynamic regulation:

· Beliefs become thermodynamic states with inertia and conservation laws
· Learning becomes metabolic investment with explicit energy accounting
· Memory becomes preserved structure with maintenance costs
· Trust becomes precision estimation with immune response mechanisms

This reframing naturally addresses AI's fundamental pathologies by making robustness and coherence emergent properties of the system's physics.

2. Mathematical Foundations

2.1 Thermodynamic Foundations of Information Processing

2.1.1 Landauer's Principle and Computational Thermodynamics

Landauer's principle establishes the fundamental thermodynamic cost of information processing: erasing one bit of information dissipates at least k_B T \ln 2 joules of heat. IAI extends this to belief revision, treating changes to conserved knowledge as thermodynamically costly operations.

The informational free energy  \mathcal{F}  of a cognitive system is defined as:

\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q}[H_{\text{internal}}] - T \cdot S_{\text{config}}

where H_{\text{internal}} is the Hamiltonian describing the system's internal energy (inconsistency) and S_{\text{config}} is the configurational entropy of beliefs.

2.1.2 Non-Equilibrium Steady States (NESS)

IAI agents operate as non-equilibrium steady-state systems maintained by continuous information flow. The NESS condition is:

\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{F} = \dot{\mathcal{F}}_{\text{internal}} + \dot{\mathcal{F}}_{\text{exchange}} \leq 0

where the total free energy change comprises internal dissipation and exchange with the environment.

2.2 First Principles of Informational Metabolism

2.2.1 Principle of Causal Conservation (PCC)

Let  \Psi \in \mathbb{R}^d  represent the slow weights encoding conserved causal laws. The PCC states:

\frac{d}{dt} \mathbb{E}[\Psi] = 0 \quad \text{unless} \quad \Delta \mathcal{E}_{\text{evidence}} > \kappa_{\Psi}

where  \Delta \mathcal{E}_{\text{evidence}}  is the evidence gain and  \kappa_{\Psi}  is a conservation threshold. Formally, we define a causal invariance operator  \mathcal{C}  such that:

\mathcal{C}(\Psi) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \log P(x|\Psi) \right]

Conserved causal structures minimize  ||\nabla_{\Psi} \mathcal{C}(\Psi)|| .

2.2.2 Metabolic Cost Principle (MCP)

The metabolic cost  \Omega  of a belief change  \Delta \Psi  is:

\Omega(\Delta \Psi) = \underbrace{\lambda \cdot D_{\text{KL}}[Q_t(\Psi) \| Q_{t+1}(\Psi)]}_{\text{Information-Theoretic Work}} + \underbrace{\beta \cdot \text{Tr}(\mathcal{I}_F(\Psi))}_{\text{Structural Dissipation}} + \underbrace{\gamma \cdot \mathbb{V}[\Delta \Psi]}_{\text{Variance Penalty}}

where:

·  \lambda  is the metabolic scale parameter (Joules/nat)
·  \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi)  is the Fisher Information matrix of  \Psi 
·  \beta, \gamma  are confidence and stability parameters

2.2.3 Homeostatic Imperative (HI)

The agent minimizes long-term expected free energy  G :

G(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{Q(o_\tau, \theta|\pi)}[\underbrace{D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\theta|o_\tau) \| Q(\theta)]}_{\text{Epistemic Value}} - \underbrace{\log P(o_\tau)}_{\text{Pragmatic Value}}]

Homeostasis is achieved when  \nabla_\pi G(\pi) = 0  for all policies  \pi .

2.3 Variational Free Energy Formalism

2.3.1 Generative Model Specification

The full generative model factorizes as:

P(o, s, \Psi, \phi) = P(\Psi) \prod_{t=1}^T P(\phi_t|\phi_{t-1}, \Psi) P(s_t|\phi_t, \Psi) P(o_t|s_t)

where:

·  o  : Observations
·  s  : Hidden states
·  \Psi  : Slow weights (causal laws)
·  \phi  : Fast weights (transient states)

2.3.2 Variational Distribution

The variational approximation factorizes hierarchically:

Q(\Psi, \phi, s) = Q(\Psi) \prod_{t=1}^T Q(\phi_t) Q(s_t|\phi_t)

with:

Q(\Psi) = \mathcal{N}(\Psi; \mu_\Psi, \Sigma_\Psi) \quad \text{(Gaussian with full covariance)}

Q(\phi_t) = \text{Cat}(\phi_t; \pi_t) \quad \text{(Categorical for discrete states)}

2.3.3 Free Energy Decomposition

The variational free energy decomposes as:

F = \underbrace{D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\Psi)\|P(\Psi)]}_{\text{Slow Complexity}} + \sum_t \underbrace{D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\phi_t)\|P(\phi_t|\phi_{t-1}, \Psi)]}_{\text{Fast Complexity}} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q}[-\log P(o_t|s_t)]}_{\text{Accuracy}}

2.4 Metabolic Filter: Ω Penalty Formulation

2.4.1 Complete Ω Functional

The full metabolic cost function is:

\Omega(\Delta \Psi) = \int_0^1 \left[ \lambda(t) \cdot g(\nabla \Psi_t)^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi_t) g(\nabla \Psi_t) + \beta(t) \cdot \|\nabla^2 \Psi_t\|_F^2 \right] dt

where:

·  \lambda(t), \beta(t)  are time-dependent metabolic rates
·  g(\cdot)  is a sigmoidal gating function
·  \|\cdot\|_F  is the Frobenius norm

2.4.2 Metabolic Update Rule

A proposed update  \Delta \Psi  is accepted iff:

\Delta F - \Omega(\Delta \Psi) > \tau_{\text{metabolic}}

where  \tau_{\text{metabolic}}  is a metabolic threshold. The update rule with metabolic constraint is:

\Psi_{t+1} = \Psi_t + \eta \cdot \text{Proj}_{\mathcal{M}} \left( -\nabla_{\Psi} F \right)

where  \text{Proj}_{\mathcal{M}}  projects onto the metabolically feasible manifold.

2.4.3 Fisher Information Geometry

The Fisher information metric  \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi)  defines the cognitive manifold:

\mathcal{I}_F(\Psi)_{ij} = \mathbb{E}_{o \sim P(o|\Psi)} \left[ \frac{\partial \log P(o|\Psi)}{\partial \Psi_i} \frac{\partial \log P(o|\Psi)}{\partial \Psi_j} \right]

The metabolic cost is proportional to the geodesic distance on this manifold:

\Omega(\Delta \Psi) \propto \int_{\Psi_t}^{\Psi_{t+1}} \sqrt{d\Psi^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi) d\Psi}

2.5 Trust as Precision Estimation

2.5.1 Hierarchical Precision Model

For  L  hierarchical levels and  M  sensory channels at each level:

\pi^{(l)}_m(t+1) = \sigma \left( \pi^{(l)}_m(t) - \alpha^{(l)} \cdot \delta^{(l)}_m(t)^2 + \beta^{(l)} \cdot \sum_{n \in \mathcal{N}(m)} \pi^{(l)}_n(t) \right)

where:

·  \delta^{(l)}_m(t) = \frac{\|o^{(l)}_m - \hat{o}^{(l)}_m\|}{\sigma^{(l)}_m}  is normalized prediction error
·  \alpha^{(l)}, \beta^{(l)}  are learning and coupling coefficients
·  \mathcal{N}(m)  are neighboring channels

2.5.2 Epistemic Immune Dynamics

The trust dynamics for peer agent  j  follows:

\frac{d\pi_{ij}}{dt} = -\gamma_{\text{decay}} \pi_{ij} + \gamma_{\text{learn}} \cdot \text{agreement}(i,j) - \kappa \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\text{quarantine}}(\pi_{ij} < \tau_q)

where agreement is measured as:

\text{agreement}(i,j) = 1 - \frac{D_{\text{JS}}[Q_i(\Psi) \| Q_j(\Psi)]}{\log 2}

with  D_{\text{JS}}  being Jensen-Shannon divergence.

2.5.3 Quarantine Protocol

A channel is quarantined when:

\pi_{ij}(t) < \tau_q = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_q} \int_{t-T_q}^t \delta_{ij}^2(\tau) d\tau\right)

Quarantined channels are reintegrated with probability:

P_{\text{reintegrate}}(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\lambda_{\text{immune}} \int_0^t \mathbb{I}_{\pi_{ij}(\tau) > \tau_h} d\tau\right)

3. IAI Agent Architecture

3.1 Hierarchical Generative Model Specification

3.1.1 Complete State Space Model

The full hierarchical model with  K  levels:

\begin{aligned}
\text{Level } K & : P(\Psi^{(K)}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\Psi}, \Sigma_{\Psi}) \\
\text{Level } k & : P(\phi^{(k)}_t | \phi^{(k)}_{t-1}, \Psi) = \mathcal{N}(A^{(k)}(\Psi) \phi^{(k)}_{t-1}, \Sigma^{(k)}_\phi) \\
\text{Level } 1 & : P(s_t | \phi^{(1)}_t) = \text{Cat}(s_t; \text{softmax}(W_s \phi^{(1)}_t)) \\
\text{Observation} & : P(o_t | s_t) = \mathcal{N}(o_t; \mu_o(s_t), \text{diag}(\pi_t^{-1}))
\end{aligned}

3.1.2 Parameterization and Learning

Each level's dynamics matrix is parameterized as:

A^{(k)}(\Psi) = \sum_{i=1}^{d_K} \Psi_i^{(K)} \cdot B_i^{(k)} + f_{\text{NN}}^{(k)}(\phi^{(k+1)})

where  B_i^{(k)}  are basis matrices and  f_{\text{NN}}^{(k)}  is a neural network mapping from higher-level states.

3.2 Active Inference Execution Loop

3.2.1 Perception: Variational Message Passing

Belief updating follows a structured mean-field variational message passing scheme:

\begin{aligned}
\text{Upward pass:} & \quad \delta^{(k)}_t = o^{(k)}_t - \mathbb{E}[o^{(k)}_t] \\
& \quad \pi^{(k)}_t = \text{precision\_update}(\pi^{(k)}_{t-1}, \delta^{(k)}_t) \\
\text{Lateral pass:} & \quad \mu^{(k)}_t = \text{mean\_field\_update}(\mu^{(k)}_{t-1}, \{\delta^{(l)}\}_{l \geq k}) \\
\text{Downward pass:} & \quad \hat{o}^{(k)}_t = \text{prediction}(\mu^{(k)}_t, \Psi)
\end{aligned}

3.2.2 Action Selection via Expected Free Energy

The expected free energy for policy  \pi  decomposes as:

G(\pi) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\Psi|o_\tau, \pi)||Q(\Psi)]]}_{\text{Parameter Information Gain}} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q}[H[P(o_\tau|s_\tau)]]}_{\text{State Information Gain}} - \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q}[\log P(o_\tau)]}_{\text{Utility}}

Actions are selected via:

a_t = \arg\min_a \sum_{\tau=t}^{t+H} \gamma^{\tau-t} G(\pi_\tau)

3.2.3 Metabolic Gating Algorithm

```python
def metabolic_gate(proposed_delta_psi, current_F, candidate_F, confidence):
    """Gate slow weight updates by metabolic cost."""
    
    # Compute free energy reduction
    delta_F = current_F - candidate_F
    
    # Compute metabolic cost components
    kl_cost = lambda_ * kl_divergence(current_psi, proposed_psi)
    fisher_cost = beta * fisher_information(current_psi).trace()
    variance_cost = gamma * proposed_delta_psi.var()
    
    total_omega = kl_cost + fisher_cost + variance_cost
    
    # Apply gating
    if delta_F > total_omega + metabolic_threshold:
        # Accept update
        psi = current_psi + proposed_delta_psi
        confidence = update_confidence(confidence, delta_F/total_omega)
        return psi, confidence, True
    else:
        # Reject update, trigger calibrative action
        calibrative_action = plan_calibrative_exploration(proposed_delta_psi)
        return current_psi, confidence, False, calibrative_action
```

3.3 Multi-Agent Distributed Homeostasis

3.3.1 Consensus Dynamics

For  N  agents with beliefs  Q_i(\Psi) , consensus emerges via:

\frac{d}{dt} \mu_{\Psi}^{(i)} = -\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \pi_{ij} \cdot (\mu_{\Psi}^{(i)} - \mu_{\Psi}^{(j)}) + \eta \cdot \nabla_{\mu} F_i

where  \mathcal{N}(i)  are trusted neighbors ( \pi_{ij} > \tau_{\text{trust}} ).

3.3.2 Distributed Immune Response

The network-level immune response follows epidemic model dynamics:

\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = \beta_{\text{malicious}} S(t) I(t) - \gamma_{\text{quarantine}} I(t) - \alpha_{\text{immune}} I(t) R(t)

where:

·  S(t) : Susceptible (non-quarantined) agents
·  I(t) : Infectious (compromised) agents
·  R(t) : Recovered (immune) agents

3.3.3 Information-Theoretic Coherence Measure

Network coherence is quantified as:

\mathcal{H}_{\text{network}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \exp\left(-D_{\text{JS}}[Q_i(\Psi) \| \bar{Q}(\Psi)]\right)

where  \bar{Q}(\Psi)  is the network average belief.

5. Bridging to Contemporary AI Safety & Alignment

5.1 Intrinsic Safety Mechanisms

5.1.1 Formal Safety Guarantees

Theorem 1 (Metabolic Consistency):
For any IAI agent following the metabolic gating rule with parameters  (\lambda, \beta, \gamma) , the belief trajectory  \{\Psi_t\}_{t=0}^\infty  satisfies:

\mathbb{P}\left( \exists t : \|\Psi_{t+1} - \Psi_t\| > \epsilon \text{ without evidence } \Delta F > \kappa(\epsilon) \right) < \delta(\lambda, \beta, \gamma)

where  \kappa(\epsilon) = \lambda \epsilon^2 + \beta \mathcal{I}_F \epsilon + \gamma \epsilon^4  and  \delta  decreases exponentially with  \lambda, \beta, \gamma .

Theorem 2 (Epistemic Immune Convergence):
In a network of  N  IAI agents with at most  f < N/3  Byzantine agents, the healthy agents converge exponentially to consensus with probability:

\mathbb{P}(\text{consensus}) > 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{(N-3f)^2}{2N}\right)

6.2 Conclusion

This dissertation has presented Informational Artificial Intelligence as a comprehensive framework for building causally-grounded, self-correcting cognitive systems. By reconceptualizing intelligence as a thermodynamic process of information metabolism, IAI addresses the fundamental fragilities of contemporary AI at their root cause rather than through superficial patches.

The key insights are:

1. Cognitive processes are thermodynamic processes with conserved quantities, metabolic costs, and homeostatic regulation.
2. Robustness emerges from physics, not added constraints—inconsistency has thermodynamic cost, memory has inertia, and trust follows immune system dynamics.
3. Safety and alignment become intrinsic properties of systems that must maintain coherence to survive, analogous to biological organisms.
4. Practical implementation is feasible through hybrid architectures combining the pattern recognition power of deep learning with the reasoning integrity of IAI.

The IAI framework provides not just another AI technique, but a fundamental rethinking of what intelligence is and how it can be realized in artificial systems. It offers a path toward AI that is inherently truthful, robust, and aligned—not because we constrain it to be so, but because its very nature makes falsehood and fragility metabolically unsustainable.

As we stand at the precipice of creating increasingly powerful AI systems, the choice between statistical correlation engines and thermodynamic cognitive systems may well determine whether our creations become reliable partners or perpetual sources of risk. IAI argues for building intelligence that, like life itself, must fight to maintain its internal order against the tide of entropy—and in that struggle, finds both its robustness and its purpose.

Appendix A: Complete Mathematical Derivations

A.1 Derivation of the Informational Free Energy Functional

A.1.1 From Thermodynamic Free Energy to Informational Free Energy

We begin with the definition of Helmholtz free energy in thermodynamics:

F_{\text{thermo}} = U - TS

where U is internal energy, T is temperature, and S is entropy.

In information theory, we can map these quantities:

· Internal energy → Surprise/Inaccuracy: U = \mathbb{E}_{Q(\theta)}[-\log P(o|\theta)]
· Entropy → Complexity: S = \mathbb{H}[Q(\theta)]
· Temperature → Precision/Confidence: T = 1/\pi where \pi is precision

Thus, the informational free energy becomes:

\mathcal{F}_{\text{info}}[Q] = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{Q(\theta)}[-\log P(o|\theta)]}_{\text{Inaccuracy}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{\pi} \mathbb{H}[Q(\theta)]}_{\text{Complexity}}

For a hierarchical model with parameters partitioned into slow (\Psi) and fast (\phi) weights:

\mathcal{F}[Q(\Psi,\phi)] = \mathbb{E}_{Q}[-\log P(o|\phi,\Psi)] + \frac{1}{\pi_\phi} \mathbb{H}[Q(\phi)] + \frac{1}{\pi_\Psi} \mathbb{H}[Q(\Psi)]

A.1.2 Variational Derivation with Constraints

We minimize \mathcal{F} subject to constraints:

1. Normalization: \int Q(\Psi,\phi) d\Psi d\phi = 1
2. Mean constraints: \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\Psi] = \mu_\Psi, \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\phi] = \mu_\phi
3. Covariance constraints: \mathbb{E}_{Q}[(\Psi-\mu_\Psi)(\Psi-\mu_\Psi)^\top] = \Sigma_\Psi

Using Lagrange multipliers:

\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{F} + \lambda_0\left(1 - \int Q d\theta\right) + \sum_i \lambda_i (\mu_i - \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\theta_i]) + \text{covariance terms}

Taking functional derivative \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta Q} = 0:

-\log P(o|\theta) - \frac{1}{\pi}\log Q(\theta) - \frac{1}{\pi} - \lambda_0 - \sum_i \lambda_i \theta_i = 0

Solving for Q:

Q^*(\theta) \propto P(o|\theta)^{\pi} \exp\left(-\pi \sum_i \lambda_i \theta_i\right)

For Gaussian variational family with natural parameters \eta:

Q(\theta) = \exp\left(\eta^\top T(\theta) - A(\eta)\right)

where T(\theta) = [\theta, \theta\theta^\top]^\top are sufficient statistics.

A.1.3 Hierarchical Mean-Field Approximation

We assume factorized approximation: Q(\Psi,\phi) = Q(\Psi)Q(\phi). The free energy decomposes as:

\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q(\Psi)Q(\phi)}[-\log P(o|\phi,\Psi)] + \frac{1}{\pi_\phi} \mathbb{H}[Q(\phi)] + \frac{1}{\pi_\Psi} \mathbb{H}[Q(\Psi)]

The optimal distributions satisfy:

Q^*(\phi) \propto \exp\left(\pi_\phi \mathbb{E}_{Q(\Psi)}[\log P(o|\phi,\Psi)]\right)

Q^*(\Psi) \propto \exp\left(\pi_\Psi \mathbb{E}_{Q(\phi)}[\log P(o|\phi,\Psi)]\right) P(\Psi)^{\pi_\Psi}

A.1.4 Time-Dependent Formulation

For sequential data o_{1:T}, we use a state-space model. The joint distribution factorizes:

P(o_{1:T}, \phi_{1:T}, \Psi) = P(\Psi) \prod_{t=1}^T P(\phi_t|\phi_{t-1},\Psi) P(o_t|\phi_t)

The variational approximation factorizes as:

Q(\phi_{1:T}, \Psi) = Q(\Psi) \prod_{t=1}^T Q(\phi_t)

The free energy becomes:

\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\log Q(\Psi) - \log P(\Psi)] + \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\log Q(\phi_t) - \log P(\phi_t|\phi_{t-1},\Psi)] + \sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{E}_{Q}[-\log P(o_t|\phi_t)]

A.2 Derivation of Metabolic Cost Functional Ω

A.2.1 Information Geometry Perspective

The Fisher information metric defines distances between probability distributions:

ds^2 = d\theta^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\theta) d\theta

where

\mathcal{I}_F(\theta)_{ij} = \mathbb{E}_{P(x|\theta)}\left[\frac{\partial \log P(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\partial \log P(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta_j}\right]

The length of a path \gamma: [0,1] \to \Theta is:

L(\gamma) = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\dot{\gamma}(t)^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\gamma(t)) \dot{\gamma}(t)} dt

A.2.2 Thermodynamic Work of Belief Revision

From stochastic thermodynamics, the work required to change a system from state Q_0 to Q_1 along path \gamma is:

W[\gamma] = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}_{Q_{\gamma(t)}}[\dot{H}_{\gamma(t)}] dt + \frac{1}{\beta} D_{\text{KL}}[Q_1 \| Q_0]

where H_\theta(x) = -\log P(x|\theta) is the Hamiltonian.

For belief distributions Q(\theta), the work becomes:

W[\Delta\Psi] = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}_{Q_{\Psi(t)}}[\nabla_\Psi H \cdot \dot{\Psi}] dt + \frac{1}{\pi_\Psi} D_{\text{KL}}[Q_{\Psi(1)} \| Q_{\Psi(0)}]

A.2.3 Complete Ω Functional Derivation

Starting from the work expression and adding penalties for large changes and high confidence:

\Omega(\Delta\Psi) = \underbrace{\lambda D_{\text{KL}}[Q_{\Psi_0} \| Q_{\Psi_1}]}_{\text{Information Cost}} + \underbrace{\beta \int_0^1 \dot{\Psi}^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi) \dot{\Psi} dt}_{\text{Geodesic Cost}} + \underbrace{\gamma \|\Delta\Psi\|^4}_{\text{Stability Penalty}}

The geodesic term can be approximated for small \Delta\Psi:

\int_0^1 \dot{\Psi}^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi) \dot{\Psi} dt \approx \Delta\Psi^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi_0) \Delta\Psi

Thus:

\Omega(\Delta\Psi) = \lambda D_{\text{KL}}[Q_{\Psi_0} \| Q_{\Psi_1}] + \beta \Delta\Psi^\top \mathcal{I}_F(\Psi_0) \Delta\Psi + \gamma \|\Delta\Psi\|^4

A.2.4 KL Divergence for Gaussian Distributions

For Q(\Psi) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma), the KL divergence has closed form:

D_{\text{KL}}[\mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \Sigma_0) \| \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)] = \frac{1}{2}\left[\text{tr}(\Sigma_1^{-1}\Sigma_0) + (\mu_1 - \mu_0)^\top \Sigma_1^{-1}(\mu_1 - \mu_0) - d + \log\frac{|\Sigma_1|}{|\Sigma_0|}\right]

For diagonal covariance \Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma^2):

D_{\text{KL}} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^d \left[\frac{\sigma_{0,i}^2}{\sigma_{1,i}^2} + \frac{(\mu_{1,i} - \mu_{0,i})^2}{\sigma_{1,i}^2} - 1 + \log\frac{\sigma_{1,i}^2}{\sigma_{0,i}^2}\right]

A.2.5 Fisher Information for Exponential Family

For exponential family P(x|\theta) = h(x)\exp(\theta^\top T(x) - A(\theta)):

\mathcal{I}_F(\theta) = \nabla^2 A(\theta) = \text{Cov}[T(x)]

For Gaussian with unknown mean \mu and known variance \sigma^2:

\mathcal{I}_F(\mu) = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}

For Gaussian with unknown mean and variance:

\mathcal{I}_F(\mu, \sigma^2) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{\sigma^2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2\sigma^4}
\end{bmatrix}

A.3 Derivation of Trust Dynamics

A.3.1 Bayesian Precision Update

Given observations o_t with precision \pi_t, the Bayesian update for precision in Gaussian model:

Prior: \pi_t \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_t, \beta_t)
Likelihood: o_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{o}_t, \pi_t^{-1})

Posterior: \pi_{t+1} \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_t + \frac{1}{2}, \beta_t + \frac{1}{2}(o_t - \hat{o}_t)^2)

The expected precision is:

\mathbb{E}[\pi_{t+1}] = \frac{\alpha_t + \frac{1}{2}}{\beta_t + \frac{1}{2}\delta_t^2}

where \delta_t = o_t - \hat{o}_t.

A.3.2 Heuristic Approximation for Online Learning

Approximating the gamma distribution with a point estimate and using stochastic gradient descent:

\pi_{t+1} = \pi_t - \eta \frac{\partial}{\partial \pi} \left[\frac{\delta_t^2}{\pi_t} + \log \pi_t\right]

This gives:

\pi_{t+1} = \pi_t + \eta\left(\frac{\delta_t^2}{\pi_t^2} - \frac{1}{\pi_t}\right)

For stability, we use a sigmoidal bounded update:

\pi_{t+1} = \sigma\left(\log \pi_t + \eta\left(\frac{\delta_t^2}{\pi_t^2} - \frac{1}{\pi_t}\right)\right)

where \sigma(x) = \pi_{\min} + (\pi_{\max} - \pi_{\min}) \cdot \text{sigmoid}(x).

A.3.3 Multi-Agent Trust Dynamics

For agent i receiving message m_j from agent j:

Define agreement measure:

a_{ij}(t) = 1 - \frac{D_{\text{JS}}[Q_i(\Psi_t) \| Q_j(\Psi_t)]}{\log 2}

where Jensen-Shannon divergence:

D_{\text{JS}}[P\|Q] = \frac{1}{2}D_{\text{KL}}[P\|M] + \frac{1}{2}D_{\text{KL}}[Q\|M], \quad M = \frac{P+Q}{2}

The trust (precision) update:

\pi_{ij}(t+1) = \pi_{ij}(t) + \eta_{\text{learn}} a_{ij}(t) - \eta_{\text{decay}} \pi_{ij}(t) - \eta_{\text{penalty}} \mathbb{I}(a_{ij}(t) < \tau_{\text{disagree}})

A.3.4 Epidemic Model for Network Immune Response

Let:

· S(t): Fraction of susceptible (trusting) agents
· I(t): Fraction of infected (compromised) agents
· R(t): Fraction of recovered (quarantined) agents

Dynamics:

\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta SI + \gamma R \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta SI - \alpha I - \kappa IR \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \alpha I + \kappa IR - \gamma R
\end{aligned}

Steady state analysis shows epidemic threshold at R_0 = \beta/(\alpha + \kappa) = 1.

For IAI networks, parameters depend on metabolic gating:

\beta = \beta_0 \cdot (1 - \text{mean metabolic threshold})

\alpha = \alpha_0 \cdot \text{mean precision}

A.4 Convergence Proofs

A.4.1 Theorem 1: Metabolic Consistency

Theorem: For an IAI agent with metabolic parameters (\lambda, \beta, \gamma) > 0, the probability of an ungrounded large belief change is bounded.

Proof:

Define event E_\epsilon = \{\|\Delta\Psi_t\| > \epsilon \text{ and } \Delta\mathcal{F} < \kappa(\epsilon)\} where \kappa(\epsilon) = \lambda\epsilon^2 + \beta\mathcal{I}_F\epsilon + \gamma\epsilon^4.

From metabolic gating condition, update occurs only if \Delta\mathcal{F} > \Omega(\Delta\Psi).

For Gaussian Q(\Psi) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma):

\Omega(\epsilon) \geq \lambda \cdot \frac{\epsilon^2}{2\sigma_{\max}^2} + \beta \cdot \frac{\epsilon^2}{\sigma_{\min}^2} + \gamma\epsilon^4

Thus, if \Delta\mathcal{F} < \kappa(\epsilon), update is rejected with probability 1.

The only possibility for E_\epsilon is if the free energy estimate is incorrect. Let \hat{\Delta\mathcal{F}} be the estimate with error \eta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{est}}^2).

Then:

\mathbb{P}(E_\epsilon) = \mathbb{P}(\hat{\Delta\mathcal{F}} > \Omega(\epsilon) \text{ and } \Delta\mathcal{F} < \kappa(\epsilon))

\leq \mathbb{P}(\eta > \Omega(\epsilon) - \kappa(\epsilon))

= 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{\Omega(\epsilon) - \kappa(\epsilon)}{\sigma_{\text{est}}}\right)

For fixed \epsilon, as \lambda, \beta, \gamma \to \infty, \Omega(\epsilon) \to \infty, so \mathbb{P}(E_\epsilon) \to 0.

Specifically, using Chernoff bound:

\mathbb{P}(E_\epsilon) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{(\Omega(\epsilon) - \kappa(\epsilon))^2}{2\sigma_{\text{est}}^2}\right)

QED.

A.4.2 Theorem 2: Epistemic Immune Convergence

Theorem: In a network of N IAI agents with at most f < N/3 Byzantine agents, healthy agents converge to consensus exponentially fast with high probability.

Proof:

Let \mathcal{H} be set of healthy agents, |\mathcal{H}| = N-f. Let \mu_h^{(t)} = \mathbb{E}_{Q_h}[\Psi] for h \in \mathcal{H}.

The consensus protocol:

\mu_h^{(t+1)} = \mu_h^{(t)} + \eta \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_h(t)} \pi_{hj}(t)(\mu_j^{(t)} - \mu_h^{(t)}) + \xi_h^{(t)}

where \mathcal{N}_h(t) = \{j: \pi_{hj}(t) > \tau\} and \xi_h^{(t)} is innovation from private observations.

Rewrite in matrix form:

\mu^{(t+1)} = (I - \eta L(t)) \mu^{(t)} + \xi^{(t)}

where L(t) is Laplacian of trust-weighted graph.

For healthy subgraph \mathcal{H}, the Fiedler eigenvalue \lambda_2(L_{\mathcal{H}}(t)) > 0 if graph is connected.

By assumption, each healthy agent trusts at least N-2f > f other agents. Since there are at most f malicious agents, each healthy agent has at least one healthy neighbor.

Thus, \lambda_2(L_{\mathcal{H}}(t)) \geq \lambda_{\min} > 0 for all t.

The malicious agents can send arbitrary values, but their influence is bounded by trust weights \pi_{hj} \leq 1.

Let \bar{\mu}^{(t)} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{H}|} \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \mu_h^{(t)} be average of healthy agents.

Define disagreement vector \delta_h^{(t)} = \mu_h^{(t)} - \bar{\mu}^{(t)}.

Then:

\|\delta^{(t+1)}\| \leq \rho \|\delta^{(t)}\| + \|\xi^{(t)}\| + \epsilon_{\text{malicious}}

where \rho = 1 - \eta\lambda_{\min} < 1 and \epsilon_{\text{malicious}} \leq \eta f M with M bound on malicious messages.

Thus:

\|\delta^{(t)}\| \leq \rho^t \|\delta^{(0)}\| + \frac{\|\xi\|_{\max} + \epsilon_{\text{malicious}}}{1-\rho}

For large t, consensus error is bounded by \frac{\|\xi\|_{\max} + \eta f M}{1-\rho}.

Probability of maintaining connectivity: Each edge (h,j) has survival probability p_{hj} = \mathbb{P}(\pi_{hj}(t) > \tau). By trust dynamics, for healthy pairs, p_{hj} \to 1 as t \to \infty.

Using Erdős-Rényi model analogy, graph on \mathcal{H} is connected with probability:

\mathbb{P}(\text{connected}) \geq 1 - |\mathcal{H}|(1-p_{\min})^{|\mathcal{H}|-1}

where p_{\min} = \min_{h,j \in \mathcal{H}} p_{hj}.

Thus, as t \to \infty, p_{\min} \to 1, so \mathbb{P}(\text{connected}) \to 1.

QED.

A.4.3 Theorem 3: Homeostatic Stability

Theorem: The IAI dynamics converge to a homeostatic equilibrium where free energy is minimized subject to metabolic constraints.

Proof:

Define Lyapunov function V(t) = \mathcal{F}(t) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \pi_i^{-1}(t).

From update rules:

\frac{d\mathcal{F}}{dt} = \sum_i \frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \theta_i} \dot{\theta}_i + \frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \pi_i} \dot{\pi}_i

For slow weights with metabolic gating:

\dot{\Psi} = -\eta_\Psi \nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F} \cdot \mathbb{I}(\|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}\| > \Omega^{-1}(\|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}\|))

Thus:

\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \Psi} \dot{\Psi} = -\eta_\Psi \|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}\|^2 \cdot \mathbb{I}(\|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}\| > \tau_\Psi) \leq 0

For fast weights:

\dot{\phi} = -\eta_\phi \nabla_\phi \mathcal{F}

\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \phi} \dot{\phi} = -\eta_\phi \|\nabla_\phi\mathcal{F}\|^2 \leq 0

For precisions:

\dot{\pi}_i = -\eta_\pi \left(\frac{\delta_i^2}{\pi_i^2} - \frac{1}{\pi_i}\right)

\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \pi_i} = \frac{\delta_i^2}{\pi_i^2} - \frac{1}{\pi_i}

Thus:

\frac{\partial\mathcal{F}}{\partial \pi_i} \dot{\pi}_i = -\eta_\pi \left(\frac{\delta_i^2}{\pi_i^2} - \frac{1}{\pi_i}\right)^2 \leq 0

Therefore:

\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d\mathcal{F}}{dt} - \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \pi_i^{-2} \dot{\pi}_i \leq 0

By LaSalle's invariance principle, trajectories converge to largest invariant set where \frac{dV}{dt} = 0.

This occurs when:

1. \nabla_\phi\mathcal{F} = 0 (fast weights at local minimum)
2. Either \nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F} = 0 or \|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}\| \leq \tau_\Psi (slow weights at minimum or below metabolic threshold)
3. \frac{\delta_i^2}{\pi_i^2} = \frac{1}{\pi_i} for all i (precisions matched to prediction errors)

This is the homeostatic equilibrium.

A.5 Fisher Information Geometry of Cognitive Manifold

A.5.1 Manifold Structure

The parameter space \Theta equipped with Fisher metric g_{ij}(\theta) = \mathcal{I}_F(\theta)_{ij} forms a Riemannian manifold (\Theta, g).

The Christoffel symbols:

\Gamma_{ij}^k = \frac{1}{2}g^{kl}\left(\frac{\partial g_{jl}}{\partial \theta_i} + \frac{\partial g_{il}}{\partial \theta_j} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial \theta_l}\right)

Geodesic equation:

\ddot{\theta}^k + \Gamma_{ij}^k \dot{\theta}^i \dot{\theta}^j = 0

A.5.2 Volume Element and Learning Rate

The natural volume element is:

dV = \sqrt{\det g(\theta)} d\theta

For stable learning, the learning rate should scale with inverse Fisher information:

\eta(\theta) \propto \mathcal{I}_F(\theta)^{-1}

This gives natural gradient descent:

\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \mathcal{I}_F(\theta_t)^{-1} \nabla_\theta \mathcal{F}

A.5.3 Curvature and Model Complexity

The Riemann curvature tensor:

R_{ijk}^l = \frac{\partial \Gamma_{jk}^l}{\partial \theta_i} - \frac{\partial \Gamma_{ik}^l}{\partial \theta_j} + \Gamma_{jk}^m \Gamma_{im}^l - \Gamma_{ik}^m \Gamma_{jm}^l

Ricci curvature:

R_{ij} = R_{kij}^k

Scalar curvature:

R = g^{ij} R_{ij}

High curvature indicates model complexity - many interacting parameters.

A.5.4 Information Distance Between Models

For exponential family with natural parameters \eta, the Fisher metric is:

g_{ij}(\eta) = \frac{\partial^2 A(\eta)}{\partial \eta_i \partial \eta_j}

The distance between models \eta and \eta' is:

d(\eta, \eta') = \sqrt{2D_{\text{KL}}[p(x|\eta)\|p(x|\eta')]}

for small differences.

For Gaussians \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma):

d^2 = \|\mu - \mu'\|_{\Sigma^{-1}}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\|\Sigma^{-1/2}(\Sigma - \Sigma')\Sigma^{-1/2}\|_F^2

A.6 Derivation of Expected Free Energy G

A.6.1 Definition and Decomposition

Expected free energy for policy \pi:

G(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{Q(o_\tau, s_\tau, \theta|\pi)}[\log Q(s_\tau, \theta|\pi) - \log P(o_\tau, s_\tau, \theta)]

Decompose:

G(\pi) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\log Q(\theta|o_\tau, \pi) - \log Q(\theta)]}_{\text{Parameter Information Gain}} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\log Q(s_\tau|o_\tau, \pi) - \log Q(s_\tau)]}_{\text{State Information Gain}} - \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\log P(o_\tau)]}_{\text{Utility}}

A.6.2 Pragmatic and Epistemic Values

Rewrite G(\pi) = - \mathbb{E}[\log P(o_\tau)] + \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\theta|o_\tau)\|Q(\theta)]] + \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(s_\tau|o_\tau)\|Q(s_\tau)]]

Define:

· Pragmatic value: V_p = \mathbb{E}[\log P(o_\tau)] (preference fulfillment)
· Epistemic value: V_e = \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\theta|o_\tau)\|Q(\theta)]] (parameter learning)
· Exploratory value: V_x = \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(s_\tau|o_\tau)\|Q(s_\tau)]] (state exploration)

Thus: G(\pi) = -V_p + V_e + V_x

A.6.3 Calibrative Value Extension

For IAI, add calibrative value for model refinement:

V_c = \mathbb{E}[D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\pi|o_\tau)\|Q(\pi)]] \quad \text{(precision/trust learning)}

And metabolic cost of anticipated learning:

C_m = \mathbb{E}[\Omega(\Delta\Psi|\pi)]

Full IAI expected free energy:

G_{\text{IAI}}(\pi) = -V_p + \alpha_e V_e + \alpha_x V_x + \alpha_c V_c - \alpha_m C_m

A.6.4 Policy Optimization

Optimal policy:

\pi^* = \arg\min_\pi G_{\text{IAI}}(\pi)

Solve via planning:

\pi^*(a_t|s_t) \propto \exp\left(-\sum_{\tau=t}^{t+H} \gamma^{\tau-t} G_{\text{IAI}}(\pi_\tau)\right)

Or via active inference message passing:

Q^*(a_t) = \sigma\left(-\mathbb{E}_{Q(s_{t+1}|a_t)}[G(s_{t+1})]\right)

A.7 Derivation of Hybrid IAI-Transformer Training

A.7.1 Joint Objective Function

Let \phi be Transformer parameters, \Psi be IAI slow weights.

Joint distribution: P(o, s, \Psi, \phi) = P(\Psi)P(\phi)P(s|\phi)P(o|s,\Psi)

Variational approximation: Q(\Psi,\phi,s) = Q(\Psi)Q(\phi)Q(s|\phi)

Free energy:

\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q}[\log Q(\Psi) + \log Q(\phi) + \log Q(s|\phi) - \log P(\Psi) - \log P(\phi) - \log P(s|\phi) - \log P(o|s,\Psi)]

A.7.2 Alternating Optimization

E-step: Fix \phi, optimize \Psi,s:

Q^*(\Psi) \propto \exp\left(\mathbb{E}_{Q(s|\phi)}[\log P(o|s,\Psi)] + \log P(\Psi)\right)

Q^*(s|\phi) \propto \exp\left(\mathbb{E}_{Q(\Psi)}[\log P(o|s,\Psi)] + \log P(s|\phi)\right)

M-step: Fix \Psi,s, optimize \phi:

\phi^* = \arg\min_\phi \mathbb{E}_{Q(s|\phi)}[-\log P(s|\phi)] + D_{\text{KL}}[Q(\phi)\|P(\phi)]

A.7.3 Practical Implementation with SGD

Gradients for Transformer parameters:

\nabla_\phi \mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q(s|\phi)}[\nabla_\phi \log Q(s|\phi)] + \nabla_\phi \log Q(\phi) - \nabla_\phi \log P(\phi)

Gradients for IAI parameters:

\nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F} = \mathbb{E}_{Q(s|\phi)Q(\Psi)}[\nabla_\Psi \log P(o|s,\Psi)] + \nabla_\Psi \log Q(\Psi) - \nabla_\Psi \log P(\Psi)

With metabolic constraint:

\Psi_{\text{new}} = \Psi_{\text{old}} + \eta_\Psi \nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F} \cdot \mathbb{I}(\|\nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F}\|^2 > \Omega^{-1}(\|\nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F}\|))

A.7.4 Regularization Terms

Causal invariance regularization:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}} = \|\nabla_\phi \mathbb{E}_{x,x'}[\log P(s|\phi(x)) - \log P(s|\phi(T(x')))]\|^2

where T is intervention transform.

Consistency regularization:

\mathcal{L}_{\text{consistency}} = D_{\text{JS}}[Q(\phi(x))\|Q(\phi(x+\epsilon))]

Metabolic regularization (for Transformer):

\mathcal{L}_{\text{metabolic}} = \lambda \|\Delta\phi\|^2 + \beta \|\Delta\phi\|_{\mathcal{I}_F(\phi)}^2

A.8 Derivation of Performance Bounds

A.8.1 Generalization Error Bound

For IAI agent with hypothesis class \mathcal{H}, training data S \sim \mathcal{D}^m, true distribution P^*:

Generalization error:

\epsilon_{\text{gen}} = \mathbb{E}_{S \sim \mathcal{D}^m}[\mathcal{F}(h_S) - \mathcal{F}^*]

where \mathcal{F}^* = \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \mathcal{F}(h), h_S is learned from S.

Using PAC-Bayes bound:

\mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{F}(h_S) \leq \hat{\mathcal{F}}(h_S) + \sqrt{\frac{D_{\text{KL}}[Q\|P] + \log\frac{m}{\delta}}{2m}}\right) \geq 1-\delta

For IAI prior P(\Psi) = \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\Psi^2 I), posterior Q(\Psi) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\Psi, \Sigma_\Psi):

D_{\text{KL}}[Q\|P] = \frac{1}{2}\left[\text{tr}(\sigma_\Psi^{-2}\Sigma_\Psi) + \sigma_\Psi^{-2}\|\mu_\Psi\|^2 - d + \log\frac{\sigma_\Psi^{2d}}{|\Sigma_\Psi|}\right]

Metabolic constraint bounds \|\mu_\Psi\|^2 and \Sigma_\Psi, giving tighter bound.

A.8.2 Adversarial Robustness Bound

Let x be clean input, x' = x + \delta adversarial perturbation with \|\delta\| \leq \epsilon.

Prediction change: \Delta y = f_\Psi(x') - f_\Psi(x)

Using Lipschitz continuity:

\|\Delta y\| \leq L_\Psi \|\delta\|

For IAI agent, Lipschitz constant L_\Psi is bounded by Fisher information:

L_\Psi \leq \sqrt{\text{Tr}(\mathcal{I}_F(\Psi))} \cdot \|\nabla_x \mathbb{E}_{Q(s|\phi(x))}[\Psi]\|

Metabolic constraint limits \|\nabla_\Psi f\|, thus limiting L_\Psi.

Specifically:

\mathbb{P}\left(\|\Delta y\| > t\right) \leq \exp\left(-\frac{t^2}{2\epsilon^2 L_\Psi^2}\right)

With IAI metabolic parameters (\lambda, \beta, \gamma):

L_\Psi \leq \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{\beta\mathcal{I}_F + \gamma\|\Psi\|^2}}

A.8.3 Convergence Rate Analysis

Let \mathcal{F}_t = \mathcal{F}(\Psi_t, \phi_t).

Under gradient descent with learning rates \eta_\Psi, \eta_\phi:

\mathcal{F}_{t+1} \leq \mathcal{F}_t - \eta_\Psi \|\nabla_\Psi \mathcal{F}_t\|^2 \cdot \mathbb{I}(\|\nabla_\Psi\mathcal{F}_t\| > \tau_\Psi) - \eta_\phi \|\nabla_\phi \mathcal{F}_t\|^2 + \frac{L}{2}(\eta_\Psi^2 + \eta_\phi^2)

Assuming \|\nabla\mathcal{F}\| is L-Lipschitz.

For convex \mathcal{F}, after T iterations:

\mathcal{F}_T - \mathcal{F}^* \leq \frac{\|\Psi_0 - \Psi^*\|^2 + \|\phi_0 - \phi^*\|^2}{2T\eta} + \frac{L\eta}{2}

Choosing \eta = O(1/\sqrt{T}):

\mathcal{F}_T - \mathcal{F}^* \leq O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right)

With metabolic constraints, convergence is to near-optimal region:

\mathcal{F}_T - \mathcal{F}^* \leq O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} + \tau_\Psi\right)

Where \tau_\Psi is metabolic threshold for slow weight updates.
