PROJECT SOLANUM-M: THE MARS POTATO EXPERIMENT - FINAL BLUEPRINT

I. MISSION CORE

Objective: Achieve the first sustainable, closed-loop food production on Mars using the potato (Solanum tuberosum) as a foundational crop. This is a dual-purpose mission: proving bio-regenerative life support for space and generating agricultural technologies for Earth. The guiding principle is "Science for Survival, Benefits for Earth."

II. THE SCIENCE: PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

The fundamental challenge is that Martian regolith is not soil—it's a toxic, nutrient-poor material. Success requires creating a functional "Martian Agricultural Substrate" (MAS).

A. Core Scientific Protocol:

1. Substrate Creation: Amend Martian regolith simulant (e.g., MMS-1) with 10-20% sterilized organic compost (from inedible plant/human waste) to introduce nutrients and improve structure.
2. Toxin Neutralization: Implement a two-stage perchlorate mitigation: (1) initial electrochemical washing, and (2) introduction of perchlorate-reducing bacteria (Dechloromonas) into the MAS.
3. Ecosystem Shift: Move beyond potato monoculture to a resilient intercropping system. Pair potatoes with nitrogen-fixing legumes (peas) and soil-structuring plants to create a more robust, mini-ecosystem.
4. Genetic Arsenal: Maintain a gene bank of 50+ potato cultivars from the International Potato Center, selected for drought and salt tolerance, with a dedicated stream for developing strains resistant to perchlorates and low-pressure growth.

B. The Technology: The "Gilgamesh" Greenhouse

· Design: A cylindrical, inflatable module buried under 2 meters of regolith for radiation and thermal shielding.
· Atmosphere: Low-pressure (10-15 kPa), CO2-enriched environment for optimal plant growth.
· Cultivation System: A hybrid approach. Primary crops grow in amended MAS beds. A separate, high-security aeroponic system nurtures the "Master Seed Bank" and conducts genetic trials.
· Automation: An AI "Farm Hand" manages the environment, irrigation, and robotic tending via multispectral imaging.

III. THE HUMAN ELEMENT: CAST & CONFLICT

The documentary's drama stems from the clash between five archetypes:

· Dr. Elena Vance (Lead Astrobiologist): The optimistic visionary. Believes the potato is key to multi-planetary life.
· Dr. Marcus Thorne (Planetary Scientist): The grounded skeptic. Prioritizes scientific integrity and highlights risks like perchlorate toxicity.
· Sarah "Mac" Mackenzie (Chief Engineer): The pragmatic fixer. Bridges science and corporate demands, facing dire trade-offs.
· Arthur Sterling (VP of Off-World Operations): The corporate driver. Demands ROI and PR milestones, creating pressure to prioritize photo ops over perfect data.
· Mateo Gomez (Analog Astronaut): The human heart. Provides raw, emotional footage from an isolated Earth-based Mars simulation, showing the psychological toll and hope.

Central Narrative Conflicts:

· Vance vs. Sterling: Science vs. Profit. Conflict over early harvest for publicity versus complete data collection.
· Vance vs. Thorne: Idealism vs. Realism. Debates on risk assessment and the true feasibility of the project.
· Mac vs. The Environment: Human vs. Nature. The constant battle to keep complex systems running in a hostile simulated environment.

IV. LEGAL & NARRATIVE ENGINE: THE MOU

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the private entity (e.g., Axiom Space) and the university (e.g., Wageningen) is the story's legal bedrock and source of tension.

Critical Clauses:

· IP & "First Right of Refusal": The corporate partner gets an exclusive first license for space-farming applications of any technology or strain developed.
· "Dual-Use" Mandate (Key Addition): A non-negotiable clause that all technologies and biological findings must be licensed non-exclusively for terrestrial use, especially for climate-adaptive agriculture on degraded lands.
· Publication Review (30-Day): The corporate partner can temporarily delay publications to protect trade secrets but cannot block the release of fundamental scientific knowledge.

V. RISK & DRAMA: THE TECHNICAL PROTOCOLS

The Technical Risk Assessment (TRA) is the script for when things go wrong.

· "The Redline" Dashboard: A visual representation of resource levels (water, O2, power). Dropping into the red triggers crisis protocols.
· "Total Loss" Threshold: Defined as >70% biomass failure within 90 Martian days. Triggers "Emergency Recovery Mode" and the agonizing decision to abort or pivot.
· Clause 4.2 - The Ultimate Choice: In a life-support emergency, the greenhouse power and water can be diverted to the crew habitat, sacrificing the experiment to save human life. This is the pinnacle of dramatic stakes.
· Toxic Harvest Protocol: All tubers must pass automated assays for radiation-induced solanine alkaloids before any consumption is permitted.

VI. DOCUMENTARY STRUCTURE: 6-EPISODE ARC

Format: Cinematic documentary series blending lab footage, analog astronaut body-cams, interviews, and CGI.

Episode Breakdown:

1. The Handshake: Establishment of the team, science, and the signing of the fateful MoU. Ends with first sprouts.
2. Earthbound: Parallels high-tech labs with Mateo's lonely analog mission. First major failure (perchlorate toxicity) occurs.
3. The Sterling Maneuver: Corporate pressure escalates. Discovery of potential solanine mutation creates an ethical crisis.
4. The Redline: Systems cascade into failure. Mac must enact Clause 4.2, sacrificing experiment chambers to save the habitat.
5. Abort or Pivot? The team attempts a desperate, untested intercropping pivot in the remaining beds under Sterling's pressure for a photo op.
6. The Harvest: A small, stunted, but viable harvest is achieved. The taste test is a somber, profound moment of reflection on the thin line between failure and a foundational step for humanity.

Visual Style: A stark contrast between the pristine, high-stakes environment of the lab, the gritty intimacy of the analog habitat footage, and the soaring CGI of the future Martian base.

This blueprint integrates hard science, human drama, legal tension, and documentary storytelling into a cohesive vision for making the monumental challenge of growing a potato on Mars a compelling narrative of ambition, conflict, and hope.
