Civilization Process Design Pattern (CPDP) – Version 1.5 

1. Core Purpose & Meta-Logic

CPDP v1.5 is a probabilistic diagnostic engine to measure civilization structural integrity.

Collapse = phase transition, driven by exhaustion of coordination mechanisms + decoupling of elites from material/social realities.

Falsifiability: model is wrong if a civilization survives 30+ years of:

High Elite Overproduction (R1)

Declining EROI

No massive corrective debt or redistribution


Post-1750 Pivot: Information Velocity Multiplier (IVM) reduces causal delays by 30–50% due to hyper-connectivity.

2. Inputs (Modular, adjustable per civilization)

1. Energy & Resources


2. Demography


3. Environment


4. Information & Memory


5. Meaning, Myth & Ideology


6. Technology & Tools (explicit module)



> Optional: add/remove inputs depending on historical or hypothetical context.

3. Transformations

1. Production


2. Distribution


3. Coordination


4. Legitimation


5. Correction / Adaptation

4. Core Causal Archetypes (R/B Loops with Delay & Polarity)

Legend:

R = Reinforcing

B = Balancing

(+/-) = polarity

Delay = temporal lag

Trigger = exogenous perturbation


R1: Elite Overproduction Cascade (Primary Driver)

Elite Aspirants ↑ (+) → Intra-Elite Competition ↑ (+) → Factionalization ↑ (+) 
→ Legitimate Authority ↓ (-) → Repression/Security Costs ↑ (+) → Complexity Load ↑ (+) 
→ Reality Decoupling ↑ (+) → Elite Overproduction (R)
Delay: 10–30 yrs per stage
Trigger: pandemic / war / invasion
Modern Modifier: debt can temporarily mask Repression Costs

R2: Environmental & Social Fragility

Resource Degradation ↑ (+) → Weak Signals Ignored ↑ (+) → Inequality ↑ (+) 
→ Social Cohesion ↓ (-) → Collective Action Capacity ↓ (-) → Faster Degradation ↑ (+)
Coupling: factionalized elite (R1) accelerates R2
Trigger: drought, flood, volcanic eruption

B1: Innovation / System Flexibility

Innovation Success ↑ (+) → Production & Distribution Efficiency ↑ (+) 
→ Elite/Mass Coupling ↑ (+) → System Flexibility ↑ (+)
Constraint: must outpace R1+R2 to prevent Red Zone
Delay: 5–10 yrs

B2: Resilience / Cohesion Buffer

Strong Social Cohesion ↑ (+) → Adaptive Governance ↑ (+) 
→ Problem-Solving Capacity ↑ (+) → Buffers R1/R2 loops (B)

R3: Popular Immiseration Loop (Optional)

Popular Immiseration ↑ (+) → Elite Consumption Runaway ↑ (+) 
→ Inequality ↑ (+) → Social Cohesion ↓ (-) → Popular Immiseration (R)

5. Elite Dynamics & Coupling (Pivot Central)

Elite Turnover Rate (% per decade)

Elite Aspirants / Positions Ratio

Elite–Mass Gap (Gini elite-specific, consumption disparity)

Elite–Reality Decoupling Index


> Feeds directly into R1/R2 loops → dominant predictor of collapse.

6. Early-Warning Dashboard & Collapse Risk Scoring

Module	Indicator	Yellow Alert	Red Alert	Weight

Elite Dynamics	Elite Aspirants Ratio	>1.5× baseline	>3× baseline	40%
Coupling	Decoupling Duration	>15 yrs ignoring weak signals	>25 yrs (systemic blindness)	20%
Complexity	Admin Cost/Capita	+3% growth / decade	+5% or more	20%
Popular Wellbeing	Real Wage / Gini	Gini >0.45	Gini >0.49 + immiseration	10%
Social Turbulence	Riots / Polarization	2–3× baseline	5× baseline (fragmentation)	10%


Composite Collapse Risk Score (0–100):

<30 → Green (Stable)

30–60 → Yellow (Watch / Adapt)

> 60 → Red (High Instability, 50–100 yr horizon)




Optional Enhancements:

Weight modifiers per civilization size, post-1750 mode, global connectivity, or tech acceleration.

Risk Timeline: shows evolution of score under Status Quo, Shock, or Innovation scenarios.

7. Debt & Time-Shifting Mechanics

Debt Buffer: financial, social, or ecological debt allows temporary Red-masking.

Expiry / Rupture Point:

Debt Service >25% of Output

Net EROI <5:1

Consequences compressed into 2–5 yr window → non-linear cascade.


Visualize Debt Expiry Year in Level 1 / 2 scans.

8. Implementation Levels

Level 1: Quick Scan (60 mins)

1. Map 5 Dashboard Indicators from proxies


2. Apply IVM if post-1750


3. Calculate raw Collapse Risk Score


4. Apply Debt-Masking Discount (10–15 pts) and note Expiry Year



Level 2: Deep Causal Mapping

1. Identify Elite Factions (Tech / Industrial / Bureaucratic / Military)


2. Quantify Coupling Gap (elite vs median citizen)


3. Run 3 Scenarios:

Status Quo

Exogenous Shock (Pandemic / War / Climate)

Innovation Breakthrough (AI / Fusion / Tech)

  end

Delays, polarities, and reinforcement/balancing labels can be added for simulation.

10. Modern / Industrial Extensions

Post-1750 Mode: Increase weight on Innovation, reduce demographic-only pressure.

Global Connectivity: Trade, migration, pandemics → multiplier on exogenous triggers.

Non-linear Tech / EROI: Temporary resilience via rapid innovation or new economic sectors.

11. Limitations & Blind Spots

Black Swan / rare extreme events

Cultural evolution non-linearities

Post-1750 exponential tech effects

Probabilistic tool: outputs indicate risk trends, not deterministic predictions
