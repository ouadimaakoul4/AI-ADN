Abstract

The Cognitive Public Finance Framework (CPFF) is a formal extension of the Cognitive Accounting Framework (CAF) to sovereign entities. It reconceptualizes state finance as a constrained, dynamic cognitive system operating within a multilayer institutional network. CPFF provides a mathematical architecture for modeling budgetary flows, legal constraints, political actors, and economic context as a Temporal Institutional Hypergraph. The framework introduces a Ψ-Core—a categorical functor encoding constitutional and legal rules—that subordinates all AI inference to legality rather than mere accounting identity. CPFF formalizes corruption detection as structural anomaly detection in institutional networks and quantifies sovereign risk as fiscal entropy accumulation. This blueprint provides the complete mathematical foundation for building explainable, audit-compatible systems for supreme audit institutions, finance ministries, and international organizations.

1. Formal Foundations: From Corporate to Sovereign Cognition

1.1 The Sovereign Cognition Problem

While CAF addressed corporate financial representation, sovereign finance introduces irreducible complexity:

· Multiple principals (citizens, legislatures, international bodies)
· Legal-constitutional constraints beyond accounting identities
· Political incentive structures that distort financial signals
· No liquidation boundary (states cannot cease existence)
· Monetary sovereignty possibilities

These features necessitate moving from Φ-Core (accounting rules) to Ψ-Core (legal-political constraints).

1.2 Mathematical Preliminaries

Let:

· T = {t₀, t₁, ..., tₙ} be discrete time intervals (fiscal periods)
· ℝ⁺ represent fiscal magnitudes (currency units)
· L be a formal language for legal provisions (first-order logic + deontic modalities)
· G = (V, E) represent institutional networks

---

2. The Institutional Accounting Hypergraph: Formal Specification

2.1 Core Definition

Definition 2.1.1 (Public Finance Temporal Hypergraph).
A state's financial-institutional system at time t is a directed, labeled, weighted, multilayer temporal hypergraph:

```
PFH(t) = (V, L, E_H(t), ω, λ, τ, ψ)
```

where:

1. Vertex Set V: V = V_g ∪ V_c ∪ V_f ∪ V_p where:
   · V_g = {v₁, ..., vₖ} government entities (ministries, agencies, SOEs)
   · V_c = {c₁, ..., cₘ} contractors/vendors
   · V_f = {f₁, ..., fₙ} financial institutions
   · V_p = {p₁, ..., pₒ} political actors/parties
2. Layer Set L: L = {L_b, L_c, L_p, L_m, L_ℓ}:
   · L_b: Budgetary layer (appropriations, transfers)
   · L_c: Contractual layer (procurement, concessions)
   · L_p: Political layer (oversight, appointments)
   · L_m: Macroeconomic layer (GDP, inflation, exchange rates)
   · L_ℓ: Legal layer (statutes, regulations, court rulings)
3. Temporal Hyperedges E_H(t): Each hyperedge e ∈ E_H(t) is a 5-tuple:
   ```
   e = (t, I_e, τ_e, ω_e, λ_e, ψ_e)
   ```
   · t ∈ T: Time of occurrence
   · I_e ⊆ V × L: Set of vertex-layer pairs involved
   · τ_e: Transaction type (appropriation, payment, guarantee, loan)
   · ω_e ∈ ℝ⁺: Fiscal magnitude
   · λ_e ∈ Σ*: Natural language justification/description
   · ψ_e ⊆ L: Applicable legal provisions
4. Weight Function ω: ω: E_H → ℝ⁺ with conservation constraint:
   ```
   ∀t ∈ T: Σ_{e∈E_H(t)} δ(e) · ω(e) = 0
   ```
   where δ(e) = +1 for revenue/receipt edges, -1 for expenditure/payment edges.
5. Labeling Function λ: Maps hyperedges to semantic descriptions from vocabulary Σ.
6. Temporal Function τ: τ: E_H → T assigns timestamps.
7. Legal Attribution ψ: ψ: E_H → 2^L maps each hyperedge to applicable legal rules.

2.2 Hypergraph Dynamics

Definition 2.2.1 (Fiscal State Vector).
The observable fiscal state is:

```
B(t) = [R(t), X(t), D(t), G(t), C(t)]ᵀ ∈ ℝ⁵
```

where:

· R(t): Total revenues
· X(t): Total expenditures
· D(t): Explicit debt
· G(t): Guarantees/contingent liabilities
· C(t): Capital commitments

Evolution follows:

```
B(t+1) = B(t) + Σ_{e∈ΔE_H(t)} Γ(e) + Ξ(t)
```

where Γ(e) maps hyperedge effects to B(t), and Ξ(t) ∼ N(0, Σ_ξ) is macroeconomic shock.

2.3 Example: Procurement as Hyperedge

A public procurement contract creates hyperedge:

```
e_procure = (t, I, τ, ω, λ, ψ)
```

where:

· I = {(Ministry, L_b), (Contractor, L_c), (Treasury, L_b), (Oversight_Committee, L_p)}
· τ = "Procurement"
· ω = Contract_Value
· λ = "Construction of Highway Section A-B"
· ψ = {Procurement_Act_§12, Appropriation_Bill_Art_7}

---

3. The Ψ-Core: Categorical Formalization of Legal Constraints

3.1 From Accounting Rules to Legal Rules

The CAF's Φ-Core enforced Assets ≡ Liabilities + Equity.
The CPFF's Ψ-Core enforces legality, mandate, and constitutional compliance.

Definition 3.1.1 (Legal Constraint Category).
Define category Leg where:

· Objects: Legal provisions {ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ...} (statutes, constitutional articles)
· Morphisms: Logical entailments ℓᵢ → ℓⱼ (e.g., Constitutional_Art_80 → Budget_Law_§5)

Definition 3.1.2 (Institutional State Category).
Define category State where:

· Objects: Valid institutional hypergraphs PFH satisfying all legal constraints
· Morphisms: Legally compliant state transitions PFH(t) → PFH(t+1)

3.2 The Ψ-Core Functor

Definition 3.2.1 (Ψ-Core).
The Ψ-Core is a faithful functor:

```
Ψ: Leg → State
```

that maps:

· Each legal provision ℓ to a sub-hypergraph template Ψ(ℓ) encoding its requirements
· Each legal entailment ℓᵢ → ℓⱼ to a compliant transition Ψ(ℓᵢ) → Ψ(ℓⱼ)

3.3 Constraint Satisfaction

Theorem 3.3.1 (Legal Compliance).
A fiscal hyperedge e is legally compliant if:

```
∀ℓ ∈ ψ(e): ∃ commutative diagram in State involving Ψ(ℓ) and e
```

Proof Sketch: If e violates any ℓ ∈ ψ(e), the diagram cannot commute because e would not factor through Ψ(ℓ). ∎

3.4 Example: Debt Ceiling Constraint

Let ℓ_debt be constitutional debt ceiling rule.
Ψ(ℓ_debt) generates predicate:

```
Ψ(ℓ_debt)(PFH(t)) = TRUE iff D(t) ≤ Debt_Ceiling
```

Any hyperedge proposing D(t+1) > Debt_Ceiling makes Ψ(ℓ_debt)(PFH(t+1)) = FALSE, violating commutativity.

4. Corruption Detection as Structural Anomaly Detection

4.1 Formalizing Corruption Patterns

Definition 4.1.1 (Corruption Hypergraph Pattern).
A corruption pattern CP is a sub-hypergraph isomorphism class characterized by:

1. Abnormal Centrality Persistence
2. Temporal Clustering around political cycles
3. Network Motif Repetition

4.2 Corruption Centrality Index (CCI)

Definition 4.2.1 (Institutional Centrality).
For vertex v ∈ V (agency/contractor), define hypergraph centrality:

```
C_H(v, t) = (Σ_{e∈E_H(t): v∈I_e} ω(e)) / (Σ_{e∈E_H(t)} ω(e))
```

Definition 4.2.2 (CCI).
The Corruption Centrality Index for v over window [t-k, t] is:

```
CCI(v, t) = (1/σ_C(v)) · |C_H(v, t) - μ_C(v)|
```

where μ_C(v), σ_C(v) are historical mean/std.dev.

Criterion 4.2.3 (Corruption Alert).
Alert if:

```
CCI(v, t) > κ₁ AND Persistence(v, [t-k,t]) > κ₂
```

where Persistence measures duration of high centrality.

4.3 Temporal Corruption Patterns

Definition 4.3.1 (Election Cycle Correlation).
Let E = {e₁, e₂, ...} election dates. Define:

```
ρ_e(v) = corr({C_H(v, t)}, {δ(t - e_i)})
```

where δ peaks near elections.

High |ρ_e(v)| indicates politically timed corruption.

4.4 Network Motif Analysis

Definition 4.4.1 (Corruption Motif).
Common suspicious patterns:

1. Shell Cascade: Agency → Shell₁ → Shell₂ → ... → Beneficiary
2. Bid Rotation: Contractors {c₁, c₂, c₃} take turns winning
3. Price Inflation: ω(e)/ω_benchmark > threshold

Algorithm 4.4.2 (Motif Detection).

```
FOR each hyperedge e ∈ E_H(t):
   IF isomorphism(e, CP_motif) > similarity_threshold:
      FLAG potential_corruption(e)
```

---

5. Sovereign Risk as Fiscal Entropy

5.1 Sovereign Accounting Graph Entropy (S-AGE)

Definition 5.1.1 (Fiscal Configuration Space).
The space of possible fiscal states given constraints Ψ:

```
Ω_Ψ(t) = {PFH(t) | Ψ(PFH(t)) = TRUE}
```

Definition 5.1.2 (S-AGE).
Sovereign Accounting Graph Entropy measures unpredictability:

```
S-AGE(t) = log |Ω_Ψ(t)| ≈ -Σ_{e∈E_H(t)} p(e) log p(e)
```

where p(e) is probability of hyperedge e given history.

Theorem 5.1.3 (Entropy Growth ⇒ Fragility).
If d(S-AGE)/dt > 0 persistently, then fiscal predictability is deteriorating, indicating latent crisis risk.
Proof Sketch: Rising entropy implies increasing number of accessible fiscal states, meaning weaker institutional constraints and higher systemic uncertainty. ∎

5.2 Early Warning Metric

Definition 5.2.1 (Fiscal Stress Indicator).

```
FSI(t) = α·(ΔS-AGE/Δt) + β·(D(t)/GDP(t)) + γ·(G(t)/R(t))
```

where α+β+γ=1.

Threshold 5.2.2 (Crisis Imminent).

```
IF FSI(t) > θ_crisis AND d(FSI)/dt > 0:
   ALERT sovereign_crisis_risk
```

5.3 Narrative-Fiscal Divergence

Definition 5.3.1 (Governance Narrative Embedding).
Let N(t) = official statements/budget documents.
n_vec(t) = BERT_fin(N(t)) ∈ ℝ^d

Definition 5.3.2 (Fiscal Reality Embedding).
f_vec(t) = f_enc(B(t)) ∈ ℝ^d (trained encoder)

Definition 5.3.3 (Governance Narrative Divergence).

```
GND(t) = 1 - cos_sim(n_vec(t), f_vec(t)) ∈ [0, 2]
```

High GND(t) indicates "say-do" gap in fiscal governance.

---

6. The Cognitive Sovereign Risk Index (CSRI)

6.1 Composite Index

Definition 6.1.1 (CSRI).
The Cognitive Sovereign Risk Index synthesizes:

```
CSRI(t) = w₁·FSI(t) + w₂·<CCI>(t) + w₃·GND(t) + w₄·M(t)
```

where:

· FSI(t): Fiscal Stress Indicator
· <CCI>(t): Average corruption centrality across high-risk vertices
· GND(t): Governance Narrative Divergence
· M(t): Macroeconomic stress (composite of inflation, growth, reserves)
· Σwᵢ = 1

6.2 Risk Classification

Classification 6.1.2 (Risk States).

```
IF CSRI(t) < θ_low:          STATE = STABLE
IF θ_low ≤ CSRI(t) < θ_med: STATE = MONITOR
IF θ_med ≤ CSRI(t) < θ_high: STATE = ELEVATED
IF CSRI(t) ≥ θ_high:         STATE = CRITICAL
```

9. Mathematical Appendix

9.1 Hypergraph Isomorphism for Corruption Patterns

Definition 9.1.1 (Pattern Matching).
Two sub-hypergraphs H₁, H₂ are isomorphic if ∃ bijection φ: V₁ → V₂ such that:

1. ∀v ∈ V₁: type(v) = type(φ(v))
2. ∀e₁ = (t₁, I₁, ...) ∈ E₁, ∃e₂ = (t₂, I₂, ...) ∈ E₂ with:
   · |t₁ - t₂| < ε_t
   · φ(I₁) = I₂ (vertex mapping)
   · |ω(e₁) - ω(e₂)|/ω(e₁) < ε_ω

9.2 Entropy Calculus

Theorem 9.2.1 (S-AGE Decomposition).

```
S-AGE(t) = S-AGE_structure(t) + S-AGE_magnitude(t) + S-AGE_timing(t)
```

where:

· S-AGE_structure: Entropy of hypergraph topology
· S-AGE_magnitude: Entropy of weight distribution
· S-AGE_timing: Entropy of temporal patterns

Proof: Follows from chain rule of entropy: H(X,Y,Z) = H(X) + H(Y|X) + H(Z|X,Y). ∎

9.3 Ψ-Core Completeness

Theorem 9.3.1 (Legal Coverage).
For any legal system with finite statutes, ∃ finite Ψ-Core such that:

```
∀ hyperedge e: legal(e) ⇔ Ψ-Core validates e
```

Proof Sketch: Construct Ψ-Core by including all legal provisions. Finiteness ensures computational tractability. ∎
