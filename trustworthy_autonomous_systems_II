Part II: Theoretical Extensions of Safety-Guarded Explainable AI to Energy Systems - Final Version

1. Introduction: Theoretical Generalization of SG-XAI

1.1 The Challenge of Domain Generalization

The Safety-Guarded Explainable AI (SG-XAI) framework developed in Part I establishes a theoretical foundation for autonomous robotic systems operating in safety-critical environments. A fundamental question arises regarding its mathematical generality: Can the SG-XAI framework extend beyond embodied robotics to other critical infrastructure domains while preserving its theoretical guarantees? This second part addresses this question through formal extension to energy systems, testing the framework's domain-agnostic properties while maintaining rigorous mathematical treatment.

1.2 Energy Systems as a Distinct Theoretical Challenge

Energy infrastructure—including power grids, industrial facilities, and fusion reactor auxiliary systems—presents unique mathematical challenges distinct from robotics:

· Differential-Algebraic Dynamics: Power flow equations combine differential (generator dynamics) and algebraic (network constraints) components
· Cascading Constraint Violations: Failures propagate through interconnected components via network effects
· Mixed Discrete-Continuous Control: Discrete switching actions (breaker operations) combined with continuous control (generator setpoints)
· Hierarchical Safety Constraints: Physical limits, regulatory requirements, and operational boundaries form nested constraint structures
· Delayed Partial Observability: State information arrives with latency, noise, and potential gaps due to measurement limitations

These characteristics necessitate both preservation of SG-XAI's core principles and domain-specific adaptations to maintain theoretical guarantees.

1.3 Research Questions (Theoretical Focus)

This part addresses four theoretical research questions:

1. RQ1 (Constraint Formulation): How must the C-POMDP formulation be extended to capture energy-specific constraints (differential-algebraic equations, cascading failures) while preserving convexity properties for optimization?
2. RQ2 (Interpretability Adaptation): What constitutes a minimal sufficient representation for interpretability in energy system control, and how does the information-theoretic formulation adapt to high-dimensional state spaces?
3. RQ3 (Safety Guarantee Preservation): Can the safety violation bounds from Part I be maintained when scaling to networked systems with propagation effects and delayed information?
4. RQ4 (Fundamental Limits): What are the theoretical limits of simultaneously achieving safety, interpretability, and performance in energy systems, and how do they compare to robotic domains?

2. Formal Problem Formulation

2.1 Energy System as Constrained POMDP with Physics

We extend the C-POMDP formulation to energy domains by incorporating physical laws directly into the constraint structure:

\mathcal{E} = (\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}_{\text{phy}}, \mathcal{O}, \Omega, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{C}_{\text{phy}}, \mathcal{C}_{\text{reg}}, \gamma, \rho_0)

where:

· \mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_{\text{cont}} \times \mathcal{S}_{\text{disc}}: Continuous states (voltages, currents, temperatures) and discrete states (equipment status, mode flags)
· \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}_{\text{cont}} \times \mathcal{A}_{\text{disc}}: Continuous control actions (generator setpoints, valve positions) and discrete actions (switch operations, mode changes)
· \mathcal{T}_{\text{phy}}(s'|s,a): Transition kernel enforcing differential-algebraic constraints f_{\text{DAE}}(s,a,s') = 0 with uncertainty \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)
· \mathcal{C}_{\text{phy}} = \{g_i^{\text{phy}}(s,a) \leq 0\}_{i=1}^m: Physical constraints derived from first principles (thermal limits, stability margins)
· \mathcal{C}_{\text{reg}} = \{h_j^{\text{reg}}(s,a) \leq 0\}_{j=1}^p: Regulatory and operational constraints (N-1 security, reserve requirements)

2.2 Physics-Informed Constraint Formalization

Safety constraints derive from physical laws with mathematical specificity:

1. Power Flow Constraints (AC formulation):

\begin{aligned}
P_i &= V_i \sum_{j=1}^n V_j (G_{ij}\cos\theta_{ij} + B_{ij}\sin\theta_{ij}) + P_{i}^{\text{inj}} \\
Q_i &= V_i \sum_{j=1}^n V_j (G_{ij}\sin\theta_{ij} - B_{ij}\cos\theta_{ij}) + Q_{i}^{\text{inj}} \\
V_i^{\min} &\leq V_i \leq V_i^{\max}, \quad \theta_i^{\min} \leq \theta_i \leq \theta_i^{\max} \\
|S_{ij}| &\leq S_{ij}^{\max} \quad \forall (i,j) \in E
\end{aligned}

1. Thermal Dynamics (equipment-specific):

C_i \frac{dT_i}{dt} = I_i^2R_i - h_iA_i(T_i - T_{\text{amb}}) - \sigma\epsilon_iA_i(T_i^4 - T_{\text{amb}}^4)

with constraint T_i(t) \leq T_i^{\max} - \kappa_i\sqrt{t} accounting for accumulated stress.

1. Cascading Failure Model (graph-theoretic):
   Let G = (V,E) with edge capacities c_{ij} and loads \ell_i. The failure propagation kernel is:

\Pr(v_j \text{ fails at } t+1 | v_i \text{ failed at } t) = \min\left(1, \frac{\ell_j}{\sum_{k \in N(j)} c_{jk} - \ell_j}\right) \cdot \eta(d_{ij})

where \eta decays with graph distance d_{ij}.

2.3 The SG-XAI Optimization Problem for Energy Systems

Extending Equation (3.1) from Part I with hierarchical constraints:

\begin{aligned}
\max_{\pi} \quad & J(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \right] \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & J_{C_i^{\text{phy}}}(\pi) \leq d_i^{\text{phy}}, \quad i = 1,\dots,m \\
& J_{C_j^{\text{reg}}}(\pi) \leq d_j^{\text{reg}}, \quad j = 1,\dots,p \\
& I(Z_\pi; \Phi_{\text{energy}}(S)) \geq I_{\min}^{\text{energy}} \\
& \pi(s) \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{feasible}}(s) \quad \forall s \in \mathcal{S} \\
& \text{CascadeDepth}(\pi) \leq D_{\max}
\end{aligned}
\tag{2.1}

where \Phi_{\text{energy}}(s) = [\text{margin}_i(s), \text{stability}_j(s), \text{efficiency}_k(s)] extracts energy-specific interpretable features.

3. Theoretical Extensions and Proofs

3.1 Cascading Constraint Preservation with Tightened Bounds

Theorem 3.1.1 (Propagation Depth Bound):
Given constraint dependency graph G_C = (V_C, E_C) with maximum indegree \Delta, and assuming SG-XAI's safety projection enforces radial containment—constraint violations remain within neighborhoods of radius r—then the probability of cascades exceeding length k is bounded by:

\Pr(\text{cascade length} \geq k | \pi_{\text{SG-XAI}}) \leq \left(\frac{\epsilon \Delta e^{1/\xi}}{1 + \epsilon(\Delta e^{1/\xi} - 1)}\right)^k

where \epsilon is the per-constraint violation probability from Theorem 4.2.1 (Part I), and \xi is the correlation length of constraint violations.

Proof:

1. Model constraint propagation as a Galton-Watson branching process with offspring distribution P(\text{degree} = d) = \binom{\Delta}{d} \epsilon^d (1-\epsilon)^{\Delta-d}
2. The containment property modifies the branching process to have absorbing boundaries at distance r
3. Apply the theory of subcritical branching processes in finite geometries
4. The correlation length \xi arises from solving E[e^{-1/\xi}] = 1 for the branching process generating function

Corollary 3.1.2 (Barrier Certificate Containment):
If for each constraint C_i there exists a barrier certificate B_i(s) satisfying:

\mathcal{L}_f B_i(s) \leq -\gamma B_i(s) + \alpha \max_{j \in N(i)} B_j(s)

with \gamma > \alpha\Delta, then cascades are contained within radius:

r_{\max} = \left\lceil \frac{\log(1/\delta) + \log(\max_i B_i(s_0)/\min_i B_i(s_0))}{\log(\gamma/(\alpha\Delta))} \right\rceil

3.2 Delayed Observability with Stability Exploitation

Theorem 3.2.1 (Stability-Compensated Delay Bound):
For linearized power system dynamics \dot{x} = A x + B u with Hurwitz matrix A (all eigenvalues satisfy \Re(\lambda_i) < 0), and observation delay \tau, the safety degradation under SG-XAI is:

J_C(\pi_{\text{SG-XAI}}) \leq d + \frac{L\|B\|}{\sigma_{\min}(Q)} \frac{1 - e^{-\beta\tau}}{\beta} \delta

where Q solves the Lyapunov equation A^\top Q + Q A = -I, and \beta = \min_i |\Re(\lambda_i)|/2.

Proof:

1. The estimation error for delayed state x(t-\tau) evolves as \dot{e} = A e + w with w bounded by \delta
2. Solve the Lyapunov equation to bound \|e(t)\| \leq \frac{\|B\|}{\sigma_{\min}(Q)} \frac{1 - e^{-\beta t}}{\beta} \delta
3. Apply Lipschitz continuity of cost functions: C(x) - C(\hat{x}) \leq L\|x - \hat{x}\|
4. Integrate over time horizon to obtain cumulative bound

Corollary 3.2.2 (Delay Margin):
The maximum tolerable delay while maintaining safety probability 1-\delta is:

\tau_{\max} = -\frac{1}{\beta} \log\left(1 - \frac{\beta\sigma_{\min}(Q)(d_{\text{margin}})}{L\|B\|\delta}\right)

where d_{\text{margin}} = d - J_C(\pi_{\text{ideal}}) is the safety margin.

3.3 Hierarchical Explanation Formalization

Definition 3.3.1 (Explanation Hierarchy):
A hierarchical explanation system for energy SG-XAI consists of three levels:

1. Physical Level (E_1): Explains which physical laws/limits dominated:
   E_1(s,a) = \arg\max_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{phy}}} \lambda_i \|\nabla g_i(s,a)\|
   where \lambda_i are Lagrange multipliers from KKT conditions.
2. Operational Level (E_2): Explains regulatory and operational considerations:
   E_2(s,a) = \{j \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{reg}} : \mu_j > \mu_{\min}\} \cup \text{OperationalMode}(s)
3. Economic Level (E_3): Explains economic trade-offs and optimization objectives:
   E_3(s,a) = \nabla_a \left( R(s,a) - \sum_i \lambda_i g_i(s,a) - \sum_j \mu_j h_j(s,a) \right)

Theorem 3.3.2 (Hierarchical Explanation Optimality):
The optimal explanation at level \ell minimizes the following trade-off:

\min_{E_\ell} \underbrace{D_{\text{KL}}(p(a|s) \| p_{\text{human}}(a|E_\ell))}_{\text{Fidelity loss}} + \beta_\ell \underbrace{H(E_\ell)}_{\text{Cognitive load}} + \gamma_\ell \underbrace{\mathbb{1}_{\{E_\ell \not\Rightarrow E_{\ell-1}\}}}_{\text{Hierarchy violation}}

The solution satisfies the information bottleneck condition:

I(A; S | E_\ell) \leq \frac{\log|\mathcal{A}|}{1 + \beta_\ell} + \frac{\gamma_\ell}{\beta_\ell}

Theorem 3.3.3 (Compositional Verification):
If explanations satisfy hierarchical consistency (E_\ell \Rightarrow E_{\ell-1}), then safety verification decomposes:

\text{Verification}(\pi) = \bigwedge_{\ell=1}^3 \text{VerifyLevel}_\ell(\pi, E_\ell)

with complexity reduction from O(\exp(n)) to O(\sum_{\ell=1}^3 c_\ell n^{k_\ell}) where k_\ell < n.

3.4 Dimensionality-Robust Interpretability

Theorem 3.4.1 (Information Bottleneck for High-Dimensional Systems):
For energy systems with state dimension d but intrinsic interpretable dimension k (number of independent constraints + objectives), the optimal representation Z satisfies:

I(Z; \Phi_{\text{energy}}(S)) \geq H(\Phi_{\text{energy}}(S)) - \frac{k}{2} \log\left(\frac{2\pi e}{k} \mathbb{E}[\|\Phi - \mathbb{E}[\Phi|Z]\|^2]\right)

Corollary 3.4.2 (Representation Dimension Scaling):
To maintain interpretability I(Z; \Phi(S)) \geq I_{\min}, the representation dimension scales as:

\dim(Z) = O\left(k \log \frac{H(\Phi)}{\max(0, H(\Phi) - I_{\min})}\right)

independent of raw state dimension d.

4. Algorithmic Adaptations for Energy Systems

4.1 Physics-Aware Safety Projection

Extend Equation (3.7) from Part I to handle differential-algebraic constraints:

\begin{aligned}
\min_{\Delta\theta} \quad & \frac{1}{2} \Delta\theta^\top H \Delta\theta + \frac{\rho}{2} \|f_{\text{DAE}}(s,\pi_{\theta+\Delta\theta}(s))\|^2 \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & C_i^{\text{phy}}(\pi_{\theta+\Delta\theta}) \leq d_i^{\text{phy}} - \epsilon_{\text{margin}} \\
& \nabla_\theta C_i^{\text{phy}} \Delta\theta \leq -\alpha C_i^{\text{phy}}(\pi_\theta) \quad \text{(for active constraints)} \\
& \| \Delta\theta \| \leq \delta_{\text{trust}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{4.1}

The second term enforces physics consistency via penalty method; the third constraint ensures active constraints become strictly satisfied.

4.2 Graph-Structured SG-XAI Decomposition

Algorithm 3 (Distributed Energy SG-XAI):

```
Input: Power network graph G = (V,E) with partition {C_i}_{i=1}^K
       Physics models {f_i}_{i=1}^K for each subsystem
       Coupling constraints {h_{ij}} between adjacent subsystems
       
Output: Local policies {π_i}, Lagrange multipliers {λ_i, μ_{ij}}

1: Initialize local policies π_i^0, multipliers λ_i^0, μ_{ij}^0
2: for iteration t = 0, 1, 2, ... until convergence do
3:   Parallel for each subsystem i:
4:     Collect local trajectories using π_i^t
5:     Estimate local costs J_i, constraint violations C_i
6:     Compute local gradient:
        g_i = ∇_{θ_i}[J_i - Σ_j λ_i^j C_i^j + Σ_{j∈N(i)} μ_{ij} h_{ij}]
7:     Update local policy: θ_i^{t+1} = θ_i^t + α g_i
8:   End parallel
9:   Exchange boundary information between adjacent subsystems
10:  Update coupling multipliers:
      μ_{ij}^{t+1} = μ_{ij}^t + β h_{ij}(π_i^{t+1}, π_j^{t+1})
11:  Update local safety multipliers:
      λ_i^{j,t+1} = max(0, λ_i^{j,t} + γ C_i^j(π_i^{t+1}))
12:  Generate hierarchical explanations for each subsystem
13: end for
```

Theorem 4.2.1 (Distributed Convergence):
Under assumptions of Lipschitz gradients (\|\nabla L_i - \nabla L_j\| \leq L \|x_i - x_j\|), bounded delays, and strong convexity of local problems, Algorithm 3 converges to a stationary point satisfying:

\|\nabla L(\theta^*, \lambda^*, \mu^*)\| \leq \epsilon \quad \text{in} \quad O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right) \text{ iterations}

where L is the global Lagrangian.

Theorem 4.2.2 (Sample Complexity with Structure):
For power networks with maximum degree \Delta, diameter D, and partition into subsystems of size n/K, the sample complexity is:

O\left(\frac{\Delta D (n/K) \log(n/K)}{(1-\gamma)^3 \epsilon^2}\right)

representing improvement from O(n^2) to near-linear in n for well-partitioned networks.

5. Fundamental Limits and Trade-offs

5.1 The Safety-Interpretability-Performance Trilemma

Theorem 5.1.1 (Pareto Frontier Characterization):
The achievable region in normalized (S, I, P) space (with S, I, P \in [0,1]) for any energy system control algorithm is bounded by:

S^2 + I^2 \leq 1 - \frac{P}{P_{\max}} + \frac{\log|\mathcal{A}| - H(A|S)}{H_{\max}} + \epsilon_{\text{struct}}

where P_{\max} is unconstrained optimal performance, H_{\max} = \log|\mathcal{A}|, and \epsilon_{\text{struct}} quantifies exploitability of problem structure.

Proof Sketch:

1. Frame as rate-distortion problem: agent must communicate action through interpretable representation
2. Safety constraints limit achievable rate via channel capacity with state-dependent cost
3. Apply information-theoretic converse for constrained channels (Gelfand-Pinsker)
4. Structure term \epsilon_{\text{struct}} emerges from problem-specific symmetries

Corollary 5.1.2 (Optimal Operating Point):
Given requirements S \geq 1-\delta and I \geq I_{\min}, the maximum achievable performance is:

P^* = P_{\max}\left(1 - (1-\delta)^2 - I_{\min}^2 + \frac{\log|\mathcal{A}| - H(A|S)}{H_{\max}} + \epsilon_{\text{struct}}\right)_+

5.2 Scalability Limits with Network Structure

Theorem 5.2.1 (Representation Dimension Lower Bound):
For an energy network with N buses, average degree \bar{d}, and locality radius r (constraints involve at most r-hop neighbors), any representation Z maintaining interpretability I(Z; \Phi(S)) \geq I_{\min} must satisfy:

\dim(Z) \geq \frac{N}{\bar{d}^r} \cdot \frac{I_{\min}}{\log(1 + \text{SNR})}

where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio in state measurements.

Corollary 5.2.2 (Sparsity Exploitation):
For typical power grids (\bar{d} \approx 3, r \approx 3), the bound becomes \dim(Z) \geq 0.037N \cdot I_{\min}/\log(1+\text{SNR}), allowing representations sublinear in N for moderate I_{\min}.

5.3 Computational Complexity Hierarchy

Theorem 5.3.1 (Complexity Classification):
The SG-XAI problem for energy systems occupies distinct complexity classes:

1. Feasibility checking: P (polynomial time) for convex constraints
2. Policy optimization with fixed structure: NP-hard (reduction from AC optimal power flow)
3. Explanation generation: #P-hard (counting explanations reduces to #SAT)
4. Verification with explanations: \Pi_2^P-complete (quantified boolean formula satisfaction)

Implication: While SG-XAI doesn't escape fundamental hardness, the hierarchical structure isolates hardness to appropriate subproblems.

6. Domain Transfer Theory

6.1 Transferable Components Classification

Definition 6.1.1 (SG-XAI Component Transferability):
A component of SG-XAI is:

1. Fully transferable: Theoretical guarantees hold identically across domains
2. Parametrically transferable: Guarantees hold with domain-specific parameters
3. Structurally transferable: Requires domain-specific reformulation but preserves proof structure
4. Domain-specific: Requires substantially different theoretical treatment

Theorem 6.1.2 (Transferability Classification):

· Fully transferable: Lagrangian dual formulation, information-theoretic interpretability definition
· Parametrically transferable: Safety violation bounds (with domain-specific Lipschitz constants)
· Structurally transferable: Explanation hierarchy (with domain-specific feature mappings)
· Domain-specific: Physics-aware projection methods, cascading failure analysis

6.2 Cross-Domain Comparison

Theorem 6.2.1 (Domain Comparison Lemma):
Let \mathcal{D}_R (robotics) and \mathcal{D}_E (energy) be two domains with SG-XAI implementations. Define:

· \alpha = \frac{\text{Constraint coupling degree in } \mathcal{D}_E}{\text{Constraint coupling degree in } \mathcal{D}_R}
· \beta = \frac{\text{State dimension in } \mathcal{D}_E}{\text{State dimension in } \mathcal{D}_R}
· \gamma = \frac{\text{Delay horizon in } \mathcal{D}_E}{\text{Delay horizon in } \mathcal{D}_R}

Then the safety guarantee transforms as:

\Pr_{\mathcal{D}_E}(\text{violation}) \leq \alpha^{\log_\Delta \beta} \cdot \gamma \cdot \Pr_{\mathcal{D}_R}(\text{violation})

where \Delta is the average degree in constraint dependency graphs.

7. Addressing Theoretical Tensions

7.1 Cascading Bounds Tightening

Conjecture 7.1.1 (Spectral Cascade Bound):
For linearized power flow near equilibrium, cascade probability satisfies:

\Pr(\text{cascade size} \geq k) \leq \exp\left(-k \cdot \frac{\lambda_2(G)}{\Delta^2}\right)

where \lambda_2(G) is the algebraic connectivity of the power grid graph.

Research Pathway: Connect to mixing time of random walks on graphs with absorbing states representing failed components.

7.2 Sample Complexity with Physical Priors

Theorem 7.2.1 (Physics-Informed Warm Start):
If policy initialization \pi_0 satisfies power flow equations and is within \epsilon_0 of optimal, then sample complexity improves to:

O\left(\frac{n \log n}{(1-\gamma)^3 (\epsilon - \epsilon_0)^2}\right)

provided \epsilon > \epsilon_0, representing exponential improvement in dependence on system size.

7.3 The Transient Stability Challenge

Open Problem 7.3.1 (Multi-Timescale Analysis):
SG-XAI assumes a single decision timescale, but energy systems exhibit:

· Fast dynamics (10-100ms): Electromechanical oscillations
· Medium dynamics (1-10s): Primary frequency control
· Slow dynamics (minutes-hours): Economic dispatch

Extending SG-XAI to handle multiple timescales with coupled safety constraints remains an open theoretical challenge requiring singular perturbation theory and time-scale separation arguments.

8. Conclusion and Theoretical Contributions

6. Theorem 6.1.2: Systematic classification of transferable components across domains

8.3 Implications for Trustworthy Energy AI

The theoretical extensions demonstrate that:

1. SG-XAI Principles Are Domain-Agnostic: The framework's mathematical core transfers successfully, validating its foundational nature.
2. Physics Enables Tighter Guarantees: Unlike generic systems, energy systems' physical structure enables stronger theoretical results through stability exploitation and locality.
3. Hierarchy Is Theoretically Necessary: The complexity classification shows that without hierarchical decomposition, verification and explanation become computationally intractable.
4. Fundamental Trade-offs Are Quantifiable: The trilemma surface provides precise guidance for system designers balancing competing objectives.

8.4 Limitations and Boundary Conditions

The theoretical guarantees require:

1. Accurate Physics Models: Known differential-algebraic equations with bounded uncertainty
2. Constraint Convexity: Safety constraints form convex feasible regions (approximately true for power flow near operating points)
3. Locality Assumptions: Constraint coupling decays with network distance
4. Timescale Separation: Control actions operate on slower timescales than fastest dynamics

Violations of these assumptions degrade guarantees proportionally to the degree of violation.

4. Formal Verification Integration: Complete integration with theorem proving and model checking

8.6 Final Synthesis

If Part I established that SG-XAI provides a rigorous foundation for trustworthy robotic autonomy, Part II establishes that SG-XAI represents a universal mathematical framework for trustworthy AI in any safety-critical cyber-physical system—with energy infrastructure serving as a rigorous validation of its generality, scalability, and theoretical robustness.

The framework demonstrates not merely that safety and explainability can coexist in energy systems, but that they must be co-designed through the mathematical principles formalized in SG-XAI. The tensions identified—between cascading bounds and network size, between delay tolerance and stability, between interpretability and dimensionality—are not flaws but precisely the places where the theory makes falsifiable predictions about the fundamental challenges of trustworthy energy autonomy.

This theoretical extension thus completes the vision of SG-XAI as a foundational theory for trustworthy autonomy across critical infrastructure domains, providing both the mathematical tools for implementation and the fundamental limits that bound what is achievable.
