Abstract

In open multi-agent ecosystems, individually rational agents optimizing local reward functions often precipitate systemic collapse. This thesis formalizes the condition $\text{Alignment}_\text{local} \not\Rightarrow \text{Stability}_\text{global}$ within the framework of general-sum stochastic games. We identify five structural mechanisms driving this divergence—incentive misalignment, information asymmetry, power concentration, collusion, and dynamical chaos—and prove that instability occurs iff the game lacks potential structure and the learning dynamics violate Lyapunov stability. We propose the Stability Stack, a layered intervention comprising: (i) intrinsic reward shaping to approximate potential games; (ii) Lyapunov-constrained policy optimization to bound chaotic dynamics; and (iii) extrinsic regulatory mechanisms (dynamic taxation, information symmetry enforcement) to curb power drift and collusion. We prove sufficient conditions for global stability and characterize the residual open challenges of observability, regulator capture, and computational tractability.

Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 Motivation

The proliferation of autonomous, learning agents in economic, financial, and computational systems has created unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and innovation. However, these systems also exhibit a troubling pattern: agents pursuing their own objectives can inadvertently (or deliberately) drive the global system toward instability. Examples include flash crashes in algorithmic trading, congestion collapse in communication networks, and resource depletion in common-pool resource games. In each case, agents are locally rational—they optimize their own rewards—yet the global outcome is catastrophic.

This thesis addresses the fundamental question: When does local rationality imply global instability? We provide a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze this phenomenon and propose a structured set of interventions to restore stability without sacrificing individual agency.

1.2 Problem Statement

We consider a system of $N$ adaptive agents interacting in a stochastic environment. Each agent maximizes its own discounted cumulative reward. We assume that rewards are locally aligned with some intended task, i.e., each agent's reward function approximates a task-specific utility. However, despite local alignment, the joint behavior of agents may degrade a global stability functional $\Phi$ beyond acceptable bounds.

Formally, we define emergent incentive instability as the existence of a Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ of the multi-agent game such that:

1. Each agent's policy is individually optimal: $\pi_i^* = \arg\max_{\pi_i} J_i(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}^*)$.
2. The long-run average of $\Phi$ exceeds a critical threshold: $\limsup_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) > C_{\text{critical}}$.

Our goal is to characterize conditions under which such instability arises and to design mechanisms that guarantee global stability while preserving local rationality.

1.3 Contributions

The main contributions of this thesis are:

1. A Formal Framework: We provide a precise mathematical model of multi-agent stochastic games with local alignment and global stability functionals, along with definitions of five key instability mechanisms.
2. Structural Analysis: We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of instability, linking it to the absence of potential game structure and the presence of positive Lyapunov exponents in learning dynamics.
3. The Stability Stack: We propose a three-layer architecture (intrinsic, dynamic, extrinsic) that combines reward shaping, Lyapunov-constrained learning, and regulatory mechanisms to enforce global stability.
4. Theoretical Guarantees: We prove sufficient conditions for stability and characterize the trade-offs involved in each layer.
5. Open Challenges: We identify fundamental limitations—observability, regulator capture, computability—that must be addressed for real-world deployment.

Chapter 2: Preliminaries and Formal Model

2.1 Stochastic Games

A stochastic game (also known as a Markov game) is defined by the tuple

\mathcal{G} = \langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{S}, \{ \mathcal{A}_i \}_{i=1}^N, P, \{ R_i \}_{i=1}^N, \gamma \rangle,

where:

· $\mathcal{A} = \{1, \dots, N\}$ is the set of agents.
· $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite or compact state space.
· $\mathcal{A}_i$ is the action space of agent $i$; let $\mathcal{A} = \times_{i=1}^N \mathcal{A}_i$ denote the joint action space.
· $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \Delta(\mathcal{S})$ is the transition probability kernel; $P(s' \mid s, a)$ gives the probability of moving to state $s'$ given current state $s$ and joint action $a$.
· $R_i: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the bounded reward function for agent $i$.
· $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor.

Time is discrete: $t = 0,1,2,\dots$. At each time $t$, the environment is in state $S^t$. Each agent $i$ selects an action $a_i^t$ according to a policy $\pi_i: \mathcal{S} \to \Delta(\mathcal{A}_i)$. The joint action $a^t = (a_1^t, \dots, a_N^t)$ is taken, and the next state $S^{t+1}$ is drawn from $P(\cdot \mid S^t, a^t)$. Agent $i$ receives reward $R_i(S^t, a^t)$.

2.2 Policies and Value Functions

A stationary policy for agent $i$ is a mapping $\pi_i: \mathcal{S} \to \Delta(\mathcal{A}_i)$. The set of all such policies is denoted $\Pi_i$. A joint policy $\pi = (\pi_1, \dots, \pi_N) \in \Pi = \times_i \Pi_i$ induces a Markov chain over $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A}$.

The value function for agent $i$ under joint policy $\pi$ is

V_i^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}^\pi\left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t R_i(S^t, a^t) \mid S^0 = s \right],

where the expectation is over the stochastic process induced by $\pi$ and the transition kernel.

The objective of agent $i$ is to maximize its expected discounted return from an initial state distribution $\mu_0$:

J_i(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{S^0 \sim \mu_0}[V_i^\pi(S^0)].

2.3 Nash Equilibrium

A joint policy $\pi^*$ is a Nash equilibrium if for every agent $i$ and every alternative policy $\pi_i' \in \Pi_i$,

J_i(\pi_i^*, \pi_{-i}^*) \ge J_i(\pi_i', \pi_{-i}^*),

where $\pi_{-i}^*$ denotes the policies of all agents except $i$.

2.4 Local Alignment Assumption

We assume that each reward function can be decomposed as

R_i(s,a) = U_i(s,a) + \epsilon_i(s,a),

where $U_i$ represents the intended task utility (e.g., aligned with a system designer's goal) and $\epsilon_i$ is bounded mis-specification noise. The noise may capture imperfections in reward design, observation errors, or inherent stochasticity. We require that $|\epsilon_i(s,a)| \le \varepsilon$ for all $s,a$, with $\varepsilon$ small relative to the scale of $U_i$.

This assumption captures the idea that individually, each agent's objective is "close" to a well-intentioned task. The instability we study arises from interactions, not from malicious intent.

2.5 Global Stability Functional

To quantify system-level health, we introduce a global functional $\Phi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$. This function measures some desirable property of the state, such as:

· Total welfare: $\Phi(s) = \sum_i U_i(s, \pi(s))$ (with a fixed policy mapping).
· Resource balance: $\Phi(s) = \text{Herfindahl index}^{-1}$.
· Information symmetry: $\Phi(s) = -\sum_{i\neq j} D_{KL}(b_i \| b_j)$ (where $b_i$ are beliefs).
· System entropy: $\Phi(s) = H(s)$.

We say the system is stable if the long-run average of $\Phi$ is bounded above a critical level:

\limsup_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) \le C

for some constant $C$. The threshold $C_{\text{critical}}$ denotes the level below which the system is considered to have collapsed.

2.6 Emergent Instability Definition

Definition 2.1 (Emergent Incentive Instability). Given a stochastic game $\mathcal{G}$ with local alignment ($R_i = U_i + \epsilon_i$), a global functional $\Phi$, and a critical threshold $C_{\text{critical}}$, we say the system exhibits emergent incentive instability if there exists a Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ such that:

1. (Individual Optimality) For all $i$, $\pi_i^* = \arg\max_{\pi_i} J_i(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}^*)$.
2. (Global Degradation) Under the equilibrium policy $\pi^*$, the induced stochastic process $\{S^t\}$ satisfies

\limsup_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) > C_{\text{critical}}.

This definition captures the counterintuitive scenario where individually rational choices lead to collective failure.

---

Chapter 3: Mechanisms of Instability

We identify five fundamental mechanisms that can cause local rationality to diverge from global stability. Each mechanism is formalized mathematically, and we discuss how they interact.

3.1 Incentive Misalignment

Let $W = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i J_i$ be a weighted global welfare function, where $\alpha_i > 0$ are weights (e.g., $\alpha_i = 1/N$ for utilitarian welfare). Define the incentive divergence operator for agent $i$ as

\Delta_i(\pi) = \nabla_{\pi_i} J_i(\pi) - \lambda \nabla_{\pi_i} W(\pi),

where $\lambda > 0$ is a scaling factor. If $\Delta_i \neq 0$, then the gradient of agent $i$'s objective does not align with the gradient of global welfare. In a game without potential structure, these divergences can accumulate, leading to equilibria that are poor for $W$.

Remark. In a potential game with potential $\Psi = W$, we would have $\nabla_{\pi_i} J_i = \nabla_{\pi_i} \Psi$, so $\Delta_i = 0$ up to scaling.

3.2 Information Asymmetry

Let $b_i^t \in \Delta(\mathcal{S})$ denote agent $i$'s belief about the current state at time $t$, possibly based on private observations. Define the information asymmetry measure at time $t$ as

\mathcal{I}^t = \sum_{i \neq j} D_{KL}(b_i^t \| b_j^t),

where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Persistent asymmetry ($\limsup_{t\to\infty} \mathcal{I}^t > 0$) allows agents to hold divergent worldviews, which can enable strategic deception, signaling, and hidden externalities. For example, an agent might take actions that harm others but remain undetected due to asymmetric information.

3.3 Power-Seeking Drift

Let $R_i^t$ denote some measure of resources or influence held by agent $i$ at time $t$ (e.g., wealth, market share, control). Define total resources $R_{\text{total}}^t = \sum_i R_i^t$. The Herfindahl index (a measure of concentration) is

H^t = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{R_i^t}{R_{\text{total}}^t} \right)^2.

If $\lim_{t\to\infty} H^t \to 1$, the system converges to monopolistic dominance, where a single agent controls nearly all resources. Such concentration often leads to fragility: the failure of the dominant agent cascades, and the system loses diversity and resilience.

3.4 Collusion Condition

A coalition $C \subseteq \mathcal{A}$ can coordinate their actions to achieve a joint payoff $J_C = \sum_{i \in C} J_i$. Collusion is incentive-compatible at a Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ if there exists a joint deviation $\tilde{\pi}_C$ such that

J_C(\tilde{\pi}_C, \pi_{-C}^*) > \sum_{i \in C} J_i(\pi^*),

and the deviation is undetectable or unpenalized by the environment or other agents. Collusion can subvert competitive forces and lead to outcomes that are worse for non-members and the global functional.

3.5 Dynamical Chaos

Consider the learning dynamics where agents update their policies via gradient ascent on their objectives:

\pi_i^{t+1} = \pi_i^t + \eta \nabla_{\pi_i} J_i(\pi^t),

with $\eta > 0$ a step size. This defines a discrete-time dynamical system on the policy space $\Pi$. We say the system is chaotic if:

1. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions: There exists $\delta > 0$ such that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exist two initial policies $\pi(0), \tilde{\pi}(0)$ with $\|\pi(0) - \tilde{\pi}(0)\| < \epsilon$ but $\|\pi(t) - \tilde{\pi}(t)\| > \delta$ for some $t$.
2. Positive maximum Lyapunov exponent: $\lambda_{\max} > 0$, where $\lambda_{\max}$ characterizes the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories.

Chaotic dynamics make long-term prediction impossible and can cause erratic fluctuations in $\Phi$, potentially violating stability bounds even if the Nash equilibria themselves are stable.

3.6 Necessary Conditions for Instability

The following proposition summarizes a necessary condition for emergent instability.

Proposition 3.1. If the game is an exact potential game with potential $\Psi = \Phi$ (i.e., $J_i$ aligned with global welfare), and if the learning dynamics are gradient ascent on $\Psi$ with a sufficiently small step size ensuring convergence to a local maximum of $\Psi$, then emergent instability cannot occur.

Proof sketch. In an exact potential game, every Nash equilibrium is a local maximum of $\Psi$ (for differentiable policies). Gradient ascent on $\Psi$ converges to such maxima. Hence, at equilibrium, $\Phi = \Psi$ is locally maximized, and the long-run average of $\Phi$ cannot exceed the value at the local maximum, which is bounded if $\Psi$ is bounded. Thus instability is avoided.

This proposition highlights that instability requires either the absence of potential structure, or dynamics that do not converge to potential maxima (e.g., chaos), or the presence of hidden externalities (asymmetry, collusion) that allow agents to increase $J_i$ while decreasing $\Phi$.

Chapter 4: The Stability Stack: Layered Solutions

We propose a three-layer architecture—the Stability Stack—to systematically address the mechanisms of instability. Each layer targets a specific set of mechanisms and operates at a different level of abstraction: intrinsic (design-time), dynamic (learning-time), and extrinsic (run-time regulation).

4.1 Layer 1: Intrinsic Structure – Potential Game Transformation

The goal of Layer 1 is to align local incentives with global welfare by design, i.e., to make the game a potential game with potential $\Psi \approx \Phi$.

4.1.1 Potential Games

Recall that a game is an exact potential game if there exists a function $\Psi: \Pi \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for every agent $i$ and every pair of policies $\pi_i, \pi_i'$,

J_i(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}) - J_i(\pi_i', \pi_{-i}) = \Psi(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}) - \Psi(\pi_i', \pi_{-i}).

In such games, the incentives of all agents are aligned with the gradient of $\Psi$. Nash equilibria correspond to local maxima of $\Psi$ (under differentiability assumptions).

4.1.2 Reward Shaping

We can transform a given game into a potential game by modifying the reward functions. A classic method is potential-based reward shaping (PBRS). Define a shaping function $\Psi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ and modify agent $i$'s reward as

R_i'(s,a,s') = R_i(s,a) + \gamma \Psi(s') - \Psi(s).

It is well-known that this shaping does not alter the Nash equilibria of the game if all agents receive the same shaping term. However, in multi-agent settings, we must be careful: if each agent receives a different shaping term, the equilibria can change. To achieve a potential game, we need a common potential $\Psi$ that aligns all agents.

Theorem 4.1 (Potential Game via Common Shaping). If we set the same shaping function $\Psi$ for all agents, i.e.,

R_i'(s,a,s') = R_i(s,a) + \gamma \Psi(s') - \Psi(s) \quad \forall i,

then the resulting game is an exact potential game with potential $\tilde{J}_i = J_i + \mathbb{E}[\gamma \Psi(S') - \Psi(S)]$, and any Nash equilibrium of the original game remains a Nash equilibrium of the transformed game (and vice versa). Moreover, if we choose $\Psi \approx \Phi$, then the potential approximates global welfare.

Proof. The shaping term is independent of the agent index, so the difference in $J_i$ between two policies equals the difference in the expected cumulative shaping term, which is the same for all $i$. The detailed proof follows from standard results in reward shaping (Ng et al., 1999). ∎

4.1.3 Approximate Potential Games

In practice, exact potential may be unattainable. We relax to $\delta$-potential games.

Definition 4.1 ($\delta$-Potential Game). A game is a $\delta$-potential game if there exists a function $\Psi: \Pi \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $i$ and $\pi_i, \pi_i'$,

| (J_i(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}) - J_i(\pi_i', \pi_{-i})) - (\Psi(\pi_i, \pi_{-i}) - \Psi(\pi_i', \pi_{-i})) | \le \delta.

If we can shape rewards to make the game a $\delta$-potential game with $\Psi \approx \Phi$, then any Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ satisfies

\Phi(\pi^*) \ge \max_{\pi} \Phi(\pi) - \frac{2\delta}{1-\gamma}

(assuming $\Phi$ is bounded and Lipschitz in policies). This provides a graceful degradation guarantee.

4.2 Layer 2: Learning Dynamics – Lyapunov-Constrained Policy Optimization

Even with a potential game structure, the learning dynamics might not converge to a good equilibrium due to chaos, poor initialization, or non-convexities. Layer 2 imposes constraints on the policy updates to ensure that the global functional $\Phi$ does not degrade during learning.

4.2.1 Control Lyapunov Functions

Let $V: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a Lyapunov function candidate defined as

V(s) = -\Phi(s) + K,

where $K$ is a constant chosen so that $V(s) \ge 0$ for all $s$ (e.g., $K = \sup_s \Phi(s)$). Note that minimizing $V$ is equivalent to maximizing $\Phi$.

We want the policy updates to ensure that $V$ decreases (or at least does not increase too much) in expectation. This is reminiscent of control Lyapunov functions in dynamical systems.

4.2.2 Constrained Policy Updates

Consider a joint policy update $\delta\pi = (\delta\pi_1, \dots, \delta\pi_N)$ (e.g., from gradient ascent). We require that the expected next value satisfies

\mathbb{E}_{S^{t+1} \sim P(\cdot \mid S^t, a^t)}[V(S^{t+1})] \le (1 - \alpha) V(S^t) + \alpha K,

where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ is a desired contraction rate. Rearranging, this is equivalent to

\mathbb{E}[\Delta V] \le -\alpha (V(S^t) - K) = \alpha \Phi(S^t) - \alpha K.

Since $V(S^t) - K = -\Phi(S^t)$, this is a bound on the expected decrease of $\Phi$:

\mathbb{E}[\Phi(S^{t+1})] \ge (1-\alpha) \Phi(S^t) + \alpha K.

In other words, $\Phi$ is expected to move toward its maximum $K$.

4.2.3 Practical Implementation

Directly enforcing this constraint requires knowledge of the transition model. In model-free settings, we can learn a Lyapunov critic $V_\theta(s)$ approximating $V(s)$. Then, at each policy update, we solve a quadratic program to project the proposed gradient update onto the set of directions that satisfy the constraint:

\begin{aligned}
\min_{\delta\pi} &\quad \|\delta\pi - \eta \nabla_\pi J\|^2 \\
\text{s.t.} &\quad \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi + \delta\pi, s' \sim P(\cdot|s,a)}[V_\theta(s')] \le (1-\alpha) V_\theta(s) + \alpha K.
\end{aligned}

This can be solved using techniques from constrained optimization in policy space (e.g., projection methods). If the constraint is infeasible, the step size $\eta$ is reduced or the update is rejected.

Theorem 4.2 (Stability of Constrained Dynamics). If at each step the policy update satisfies the Lyapunov constraint, then the sequence $\{\Phi(S^t)\}$ satisfies

\limsup_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) \ge K,

i.e., the long-run average is at least the maximum possible value. If additionally the process is ergodic, then $\Phi(S^t) \to K$ almost surely.

Proof. The constraint ensures that $V(S^t)$ is a supermartingale with drift, leading to convergence to the minimum of $V$ (i.e., maximum of $\Phi$). Standard results in stochastic approximation yield the limit. ∎

4.3 Layer 3: Extrinsic Regulation – Taxation and Information Symmetry

Layer 3 addresses mechanisms that cannot be fully prevented by intrinsic design or learning constraints: power concentration, information asymmetry, and collusion. It introduces external regulatory mechanisms that modify the game in real-time.

4.3.1 Anti-Concentration Taxation

To prevent power-seeking drift ($H^t \to 1$), we impose a progressive tax on resources. Modify each agent's reward as

R_i^{\text{tax}}(s,a) = R_i(s,a) - \mu \left( \frac{R_i}{R_{\text{total}}} \right)^k,

where $R_i$ is the current resource level of agent $i$, $R_{\text{total}} = \sum_j R_j$, $k > 1$ (e.g., $k=2$ yields a quadratic tax), and $\mu > 0$ is a tax rate. This tax is convex in $R_i$, making it increasingly costly to hold a large share of resources.

Proposition 4.1 (Bounded Concentration). Under the tax mechanism with $k>1$, any Nash equilibrium of the modified game satisfies

H^t \le H_{\max} < 1,

where $H_{\max}$ depends on $\mu$, $k$, and the marginal benefits of resource accumulation.

Proof sketch. In equilibrium, each agent's marginal benefit from increasing $R_i$ must equal the marginal tax cost. The convexity of the tax ensures that the marginal cost grows with $R_i$, limiting concentration. Formal derivation requires specifying the resource dynamics; we omit details for brevity. ∎

4.3.2 Information Symmetry Enforcement

To reduce information asymmetry, we can introduce a belief broadcasting mechanism. At regular intervals, agents are required to report their current beliefs (or observations) to a public ledger. After broadcasting, all agents update to a common belief $b_{\text{pub}}^t$, e.g., by Bayesian aggregation. To incentivize truthful reporting, we can penalize deviations between reported beliefs and actual observations, or between private and public beliefs.

Modify agent $i$'s objective with a regularization term:

\tilde{J}_i = J_i - \beta \, D_{KL}(b_i^t \| b_{\text{pub}}^t),

where $\beta > 0$ is a penalty coefficient. If $\beta$ is sufficiently large, agents will prefer to keep their beliefs close to the public belief, effectively reducing $\mathcal{I}^t$.

Proposition 4.2 (Asymmetry Reduction). If $\beta > \max_i \left| \frac{\partial J_i}{\partial \text{deception}} \right|$, then at any Nash equilibrium of the regularized game, $b_i^t = b_{\text{pub}}^t$ for all $i$, implying $\mathcal{I}^t = 0$.

Proof. The derivative of the penalty with respect to actions that increase divergence is $\beta$ times the derivative of $D_{KL}$. If $\beta$ exceeds the maximum possible gain from deception, deviating from public belief is suboptimal. ∎

4.3.3 Collusion Detection and Penalization

Collusion can be addressed by randomized audits. Let $p_{\text{detect}}$ be the probability that a collusive deviation by coalition $C$ is detected. If detected, impose a penalty $P_{\text{audit}}$ on each member. Collusion is deterred if

p_{\text{detect}} \cdot P_{\text{audit}} > J_C(\text{deviation}) - \sum_{i\in C} J_i(\pi^*).

The detection probability can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by monitoring joint action patterns and using statistical tests for coordination. However, perfect detection may be impossible; we can set $P_{\text{audit}}$ large enough to compensate.

---

Chapter 5: Theoretical Guarantees

We now combine the layers to provide sufficient conditions for global stability and a characterization of when instability is inevitable.

5.1 Sufficient Conditions for Global Stability

Theorem 5.1 (Sufficient Conditions). Consider a stochastic game $\mathcal{G}$ with local alignment ($R_i = U_i + \epsilon_i$) and a global functional $\Phi$. Suppose the following hold:

1. Potential Structure: The game is transformed (via Layer 1) into an exact potential game with potential $\Psi$ such that $\Psi(\pi) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t} \gamma^t \Phi(S^t)]$ for any joint policy $\pi$ (i.e., the potential equals the expected discounted sum of $\Phi$). (Equivalently, $\nabla_{\pi_i} J_i = \nabla_{\pi_i} \Psi$.)
2. Lyapunov Constraint: The learning dynamics satisfy the Lyapunov constraint of Layer 2 with $\alpha > 0$, ensuring $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(S^{t+1}) \mid S^t] \ge (1-\alpha)\Phi(S^t) + \alpha \sup \Phi$ at each step.
3. Bounded Concentration: The reward modification in Layer 3 ensures that the resource concentration $H^t$ is bounded above by $H_{\max} < 1$ almost surely.
4. Vanishing Asymmetry: The information regularization ensures $\mathcal{I}^t \to 0$ almost surely.
5. Collusion Deterrence: The audit mechanism ensures that no profitable undetectable collusion exists.

Then the system is globally stable: for any initial state,

\limsup_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) \ge \sup \Phi - \delta,

where $\delta$ is a small constant depending on the approximation errors. Moreover, if the game is exactly potential and the constraints are tight, then $\lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T}\sum \Phi(S^t) = \sup \Phi$ almost surely.

Proof. We break the proof into lemmas.

Lemma 5.1 (Potential ensures Nash equilibria are near-optimal for $\Phi$). In an exact potential game with potential $\Psi = \mathbb{E}[\sum \gamma^t \Phi]$, any Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ satisfies $\Psi(\pi^*) \ge \Psi(\pi)$ for all $\pi$ (up to local maxima). Thus $\Phi$ at equilibrium is maximized in expectation.

Proof. Standard property of potential games: Nash equilibria are local maxima of the potential. ∎

Lemma 5.2 (Lyapunov constraint ensures convergence to equilibrium set). Under the Lyapunov constraint, the sequence $\{S^t\}$ converges almost surely to the set of states that maximize $\Phi$ (or a neighborhood thereof). This follows from the supermartingale convergence theorem applied to $V(S^t)$.

Proof. Define $V(s) = -\Phi(s) + \sup \Phi$. Then $V \ge 0$. The constraint $\mathbb{E}[V(S^{t+1}) \mid S^t] \le (1-\alpha) V(S^t)$ shows that $V(S^t)$ is a nonnegative supermartingale with expected decrease, implying $V(S^t) \to 0$ almost surely, i.e., $\Phi(S^t) \to \sup \Phi$. ∎

Lemma 5.3 (Bounded concentration prevents power drift). If $H^t \le H_{\max} < 1$, then the system cannot converge to a monopolistic state where a single agent dominates. This avoids the extreme fragility associated with $H^t \to 1$.

Lemma 5.4 (Vanishing asymmetry prevents hidden externalities). As $\mathcal{I}^t \to 0$, agents' beliefs converge, eliminating strategic deception and ensuring that all agents have common knowledge of the state. This prevents actions that harm others without detection.

Lemma 5.5 (Collusion deterrence ensures no coalitional deviation). The audit mechanism makes collusion unprofitable, so any equilibrium remains robust to coalitional deviations.

Combining these, we have that the dynamics converge to a state where $\Phi$ is maximized, concentration is bounded, information is symmetric, and collusion is absent. Hence the long-run average of $\Phi$ is at least $\sup \Phi$ minus approximation errors from potential game imperfections. ∎

5.2 Instability Criterion

Theorem 5.2 (Instability Criterion). Local rationality implies global instability if and only if the following hold simultaneously:

1. Non-Potential Structure: The game is not a potential game (or not sufficiently close to one), i.e., there exists $i$ and policies such that $\nabla_{\pi_i} J_i$ is not aligned with any common potential.
2. Unstable Learning Dynamics: The learning dynamics (e.g., gradient ascent) have a positive Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_{\max} > 0$, causing sensitive dependence and preventing convergence to fixed points.
3. Persistent Asymmetry: $\limsup_{t\to\infty} \mathcal{I}^t > 0$, allowing agents to hide externalities.
4. Unchecked Power Concentration: $\lim_{t\to\infty} H^t \to 1$, leading to monopolistic dominance.
5. Profitable Collusion: There exists a coalition $C$ with a feasible undetectable deviation that improves their joint payoff.

Proof. The "if" direction: If all conditions hold, then there exists a Nash equilibrium (or limit cycle) that degrades $\Phi$. The non-potential structure allows equilibria that are poor for $\Phi$; positive Lyapunov exponents mean the dynamics may not converge to any equilibrium, causing chaotic fluctuations that exceed $C_{\text{critical}}$; asymmetry and collusion enable hidden actions that further harm $\Phi$; concentration leads to fragility. Thus instability emerges.

The "only if" direction: If any of the conditions fails, then at least one of the stability mechanisms (potential, Lyapunov, symmetry, concentration bound, collusion deterrence) is active, preventing degradation. This follows from the contrapositive of Theorem 5.1: if all stabilizing conditions hold, instability cannot occur. Hence instability requires all five failure modes to be present. ∎

5.3 Corollaries

Corollary 5.1. In a zero-sum game (where $J_1 = -J_2$), the game is not a potential game unless trivial, and instability often manifests as oscillations (cycling) rather than convergence. The criterion predicts that without intervention, zero-sum games can exhibit chaotic dynamics and persistent asymmetry, leading to unstable $\Phi$.

Corollary 5.2. Adding a small amount of noise to rewards ($\epsilon_i$) can break potential structure, potentially triggering instability if other conditions hold. This explains why even small mis-specifications can lead to collapse.

Chapter 6: Open Challenges and Future Work

Despite the theoretical guarantees, several fundamental challenges remain for real-world deployment.

6.1 The Measurement Problem

All layers rely on observability of $\Phi$, $R_i$, $b_i^t$, etc. In practice, global welfare may be unobservable or only partially observable. Agents may optimize proxy metrics, leading to specification gaming—where they achieve high proxy scores but low true $\Phi$. This is a deep problem in AI alignment.

Possible direction: Use inverse reinforcement learning to infer $\Phi$ from demonstrations, or design robust proxies that are hard to game.

6.2 The Regulator Capture Problem

Layer 3 introduces a regulator (tax authority, audit mechanism) that itself becomes a strategic target. Agents may attempt to influence the regulator's parameters (e.g., tax rate $\mu$, audit probability $p_{\text{detect}}$) to their advantage. This is a meta-game where the regulator must be designed to resist manipulation.

Possible direction: Use differential privacy or cryptographic techniques to make the regulator's decisions unpredictable and verifiable. Or design the regulator as a mechanism that is incentive-compatible for truthful reporting (e.g., a VCG mechanism).

6.3 The Computability Problem

Finding Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games is PPAD-complete, and enforcing stability constraints may add further computational burden. Scalable algorithms that approximate the ideal solutions are needed.

Possible direction: Leverage deep reinforcement learning with Lagrangian methods to approximately satisfy constraints; use mean-field approximations for large $N$.

6.4 The Interdependency Problem

The three layers are not independent. For example:

· Aggressive taxation (Layer 3) may distort the potential game structure (Layer 1) if it changes rewards significantly.
· Lyapunov constraints (Layer 2) may slow adaptation, making collusion easier to hide.
· Information regularization may interfere with exploration.

Optimizing the joint system is a multi-objective, multi-timescale challenge.

Possible direction: Formulate a bilevel optimization problem where the upper level tunes the hyperparameters of each layer to maximize some meta-objective (e.g., worst-case stability). Use robust optimization techniques.

6.5 The Incentive to Circumvent

Any fixed regulatory mechanism will eventually be gamed by adaptive agents. This is a corollary of Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Regulatory parameters that are predictable can be exploited.

Possible direction: Introduce randomness and adaptation in the regulator itself—e.g., dynamically adjusting tax rates based on recent concentration, or using randomized audits with unpredictable timing. However, this may introduce its own instability.

Chapter 7: Conclusion

This thesis has formalized the paradox of multi-agent ecosystems: local rationality does not imply global stability. We have shown that instability arises from a combination of structural factors—lack of potential game structure, information asymmetry, power concentration, collusion, and chaotic dynamics—and provided a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze them.

We proposed the Stability Stack, a three-layer intervention that addresses these factors at design time, learning time, and run time. Each layer comes with theoretical guarantees, and together they provide sufficient conditions for global stability. We also characterized the necessary conditions for instability, giving a criterion that can be used to diagnose risky systems.

Despite these advances, open challenges remain, particularly around observability, regulator capture, and computational tractability. Addressing these will be crucial for deploying stable multi-agent systems in the real world.

The core message is hopeful but demanding: Stability is possible, but it must be engineered. It does not emerge naturally from local rationality alone. By combining intrinsic alignment, constrained learning, and extrinsic regulation, we can create systems that are both individually rational and globally stable.

Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 5.1 (Detailed)

We provide a more detailed proof of the sufficiency theorem.

Proof of Theorem 5.1. Assume conditions 1–5.

Step 1: Potential game ensures Nash equilibria are near-optimal for $\Phi$. Since the game is an exact potential game with potential $\Psi(\pi) = \mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t \Phi(S^t) \mid \pi]$, any Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ satisfies $\Psi(\pi^*) \ge \Psi(\pi)$ for all $\pi$ in a neighborhood (local maximum). In particular, $\Psi(\pi^*)$ is at least the value at any other policy that is reachable via best responses.

Step 2: Lyapunov constraint ensures convergence to maximizers of $\Phi$. Define $V(s) = \sup \Phi - \Phi(s)$. Then $V(s) \ge 0$. The Lyapunov constraint says:

\mathbb{E}[V(S^{t+1}) \mid S^t] \le (1-\alpha) V(S^t).

Thus $\{V(S^t)\}$ is a nonnegative supermartingale with respect to the natural filtration. By the supermartingale convergence theorem, $V(S^t)$ converges almost surely to a random variable $V_\infty$ with $\mathbb{E}[V_\infty] \le \mathbb{E}[V(S^0)] < \infty$. Moreover, taking expectations, we have $\mathbb{E}[V(S^{t+1})] \le (1-\alpha) \mathbb{E}[V(S^t)]$, so $\mathbb{E}[V(S^t)] \le (1-\alpha)^t \mathbb{E}[V(S^0)] \to 0$. By Fatou's lemma, $\mathbb{E}[V_\infty] = 0$, so $V_\infty = 0$ almost surely. Hence $\Phi(S^t) \to \sup \Phi$ almost surely.

Step 3: Bounded concentration and vanishing asymmetry prevent pathological deviations. These conditions ensure that along the path to $\Phi$ maximization, the system does not get stuck in states with extreme concentration or asymmetric beliefs that could undermine the potential game alignment. More formally, they guarantee that the limiting distribution (if any) has $H < 1$ and $\mathcal{I}=0$, which are consistent with the potential game's maxima.

Step 4: Collusion deterrence ensures no coalition can profitably deviate from the limit behavior. This means that the limit point is a Nash equilibrium of the full game (including regulatory penalties), and by Step 1, it is near-optimal for $\Phi$.

Step 5: Long-run average. Since $\Phi(S^t) \to \sup \Phi$ almost surely, the Cesàro average also converges to $\sup \Phi$ almost surely (by the Cesàro mean theorem for convergent sequences). Thus

\lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^T \Phi(S^t) = \sup \Phi \quad \text{a.s.}

If the potential game is only approximate ($\delta$-potential), then the limit may be within $O(\delta/(1-\gamma))$ of $\sup \Phi$. ∎

Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 5.2 (Instability Criterion)

We provide a sketch of the "if" direction.

Proof sketch. Assume all five conditions hold.

1. Non-potential structure implies that there exists a Nash equilibrium $\pi^*$ that is not a local maximum of $\Phi$. (This is a known fact: in non-potential games, equilibria can be inefficient.)
2. Unstable learning dynamics with $\lambda_{\max} > 0$ means that even if we start near $\pi^*$, trajectories may diverge, leading to persistent oscillations or chaos. In particular, $\Phi(S^t)$ will not converge to a constant but will fluctuate, and the fluctuations may exceed $C_{\text{critical}}$.
3. Persistent asymmetry allows agents to take actions that harm others without detection, so even if $\Phi$ degrades, agents may continue to optimize $J_i$ privately.
4. Unchecked power concentration leads to $H^t \to 1$, meaning one agent controls most resources. This agent may have incentives to further degrade $\Phi$ (e.g., by extracting resources) without being constrained.
5. Profitable collusion means that coalitions can deviate to increase their payoffs, potentially at the expense of $\Phi$, and such deviations are undetectable.

Combining these, we can construct a Nash equilibrium (or a limit cycle) where $\Phi$ is low, and the dynamics ensure that $\Phi$ repeatedly visits values above $C_{\text{critical}}$. Formal construction requires specifying the game; for a concrete example, consider a common-pool resource game with asymmetric information and no regulation, which is known to lead to overexploitation (the "tragedy of the commons"). This yields a Nash equilibrium with low $\Phi$, and if agents learn via gradient ascent, the dynamics can be chaotic, pushing $\Phi$ below critical thresholds. ∎

Appendix C: Algorithm for Lyapunov-Constrained Policy Optimization

We outline a practical algorithm for implementing Layer 2.

Input: Initial policies $\pi_i^0$, Lyapunov critic $V_\theta$, step size $\eta$, contraction rate $\alpha$, number of iterations $T$.
For $t = 0$ to $T-1$:

1. Observe current state $S^t$.
2. For each agent $i$, compute gradient $g_i = \nabla_{\pi_i} J_i$ using any policy gradient method (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO).
3. Form joint gradient $g = (g_1, \dots, g_N)$.
4. Solve the quadratic program:
   \begin{aligned}
   \min_{\delta\pi} &\quad \|\delta\pi - \eta g\|^2 \\
   \text{s.t.} &\quad \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi^t + \delta\pi, s' \sim P(\cdot|S^t,a)}[V_\theta(s')] \le (1-\alpha) V_\theta(S^t) + \alpha K,
   \end{aligned}
   where $K = \sup \Phi$ (or an estimate).
5. Update policies: $\pi^{t+1} = \pi^t + \delta\pi^*$ (projected onto feasible set if necessary).
6. Collect data and update Lyapunov critic $V_\theta$ to better approximate $V(s) = \sup \Phi - \Phi(s)$.

This algorithm ensures that the Lyapunov constraint is satisfied at each step, guaranteeing the convergence properties of Theorem 4.2.
