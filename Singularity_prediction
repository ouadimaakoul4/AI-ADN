1. Conceptual Framework

We define the AI ecosystem as a complex, adaptive, self-reinforcing system:

\text{AI System} = f(\text{Models}, \text{Compute}, \text{Algorithmic Efficiency}, \text{Data Availability})

Where:

Models  = Number of significant AI models released at time  (Claude, Grok, Perplexity, Quinn, Diptyque, etc.)

Compute  = Total computational power dedicated to AI at time  (FLOPS)

Algorithmic Efficiency  = Improvement in AI per unit compute (measurable via benchmark scores, e.g., MMLU, GLUE)

Data Availability  = Total usable data for training AI models


Assumption: Each variable grows over time, with interdependencies producing exponential or super-exponential growth.


---

2. Fundamental Mathematical Model

2.1 Number of Models

The growth of the number of significant AI models is self-reinforcing:

\frac{dN}{dt} = k_N \cdot N(t)

 = growth rate constant of AI model emergence

Solution:


N(t) = N_0 e^{k_N t}

 = initial number of models (e.g., ChatGPT launch baseline)



---

2.2 Total Compute

The total computational power grows similarly:

\frac{dP}{dt} = k_P \cdot P(t)

 = growth rate constant of compute resources

Solution:


P(t) = P_0 e^{k_P t}

 = initial compute capacity (e.g., GPT-3 scale)



---

2.3 Algorithmic Efficiency

Algorithmic improvements multiply the effectiveness of compute:

\frac{dE}{dt} = k_E \cdot E(t)

 = effective AI capability per unit compute

Solution:


E(t) = E_0 e^{k_E t}


---

2.4 Effective AI Capability

We define the overall AI capability  as:

C(t) = N(t) \cdot P(t) \cdot E(t)

Substituting the exponential solutions:

C(t) = N_0 P_0 E_0 \cdot e^{(k_N + k_P + k_E) t}

✅ This is an exponential growth model, capturing post-ChatGPT acceleration.


---

2.5 Threshold for AGI / OGI

Let  = capability threshold required for AGI / OGI. Then the time  to reach it satisfies:

C(t_s) = S

t_s = \frac{1}{k_N + k_P + k_E} \ln \left( \frac{S}{N_0 P_0 E_0} \right)

This is a first-order prediction of when AGI may emerge, under the assumption of continued exponential growth.



---

3. Energy and Physical Constraints

To make the model realistic, we include thermodynamic and energy limits:

\text{Power Consumption} = \alpha \cdot P(t)

\text{Cooling Limitations: } \beta \cdot P(t) \leq \text{Max Sustainable Thermal Dissipation}

 = energy per unit compute

 = scaling factor for heat dissipation efficiency

If , growth is throttled → introduces logistic growth behavior.


Adjusted AI capability model (logistic):

\frac{dC}{dt} = r \cdot C(t) \left(1 - \frac{C(t)}{C_{\text{max}}} \right)

Where  = physical/thermodynamic upper bound

This accounts for saturation effects in real-world hardware and energy constraints.



---

4. Scenario Modeling: Acceleration Paths

1. Baseline Exponential Scenario

Assumes no physical or economic limits

Fastest path to singularity (postulated 2026–2035)



2. Energy-Constrained Logistic Scenario

Includes GPU energy & cooling limitations

Slows acceleration, AGI predicted later (2035–2045)



3. Algorithmic Breakthrough Scenario

 grows super-exponentially due to paradigm-shifting algorithms

Could shorten AGI timeline dramatically

5. Summary of the Blueprint

Variables: 

Core Equations: Exponential growth + threshold for AGI

Constraints: Thermodynamics & energy → logistic adjustment

Outcome: Predictive timeline for AGI / OGI, scenario analysis, and singularity probability

📊 Step 1 — Real Data on AI Compute & Models

Compute Growth

Historical data shows that compute used in AI training has grown exponentially, roughly 4× to 5× per year over the past decade. 
For example:

GPT‑3 (2020): ~314 M petaFLOPs

Minerva (2022): ~2.7 billion petaFLOPs

Frontier models now exceed 10²⁵ floating point operations (FLOP) in a single training run. 


This means the total computation capacity for AI is not linear — it has grown by orders of magnitude in just a few years.

Model Release Explosion

By mid‑2025, there were already 30+ large models trained above GPT‑4 scale (>10²⁵ FLOPs) and counting, with an average of roughly 2 such models released each month in 2024. 
Projections suggest that by 2027 we might see ~30 models above 10²⁶ FLOPs, and by 2030 over 200 at that threshold. 

Industry Growth in Compute Infrastructure

Big players are rapidly expanding compute infrastructure:

Amazon’s Project Rainier aims to use >1 million Trainium2 chips by end of 2025 for large models like Claude. 

xAI has ambitions of deploying the equivalent of 50 million H100‑class GPUs by 2030 (equivalent to ~50 ExaFLOPS). 

AMD’s CEO said AI compute needs could exceed 10 yottaflops globally within five years. 



---

📈 Step 2 — Estimating Growth Parameters

We use the exponential model from the blueprint:

C(t) = C_0 \cdot e^{(k_N + k_P + k_E)t}

Here we focus on compute growth and model counts as measurable proxies.


---

📍 Empirical Compute Growth Rates

A reasonable estimate based on historical analysis:

Compute for frontier AI grows ~4× per year — we model this as an exponential with a growth constant .


k_P = \ln(4) \approx 1.386

If  is the compute level in 2022 (baseline) and  is measured in years since 2022, then:

C(t) = C_0 e^{1.386 t}

Result:

2023 → ~4× 2022

2024 → ~16× 2022

2025 → ~64× 2022

2026 → ~256× 2022


So by early 2026 AI compute capacity is multiple orders of magnitude above 2022 baseline. 


---

📍 Model Count Growth

Empirical trend:

~2 models above threshold per month in 2024 → ~24/year

Extrapolations show superlinear growth, meaning new models per year increases faster as compute thresholds increase. 


For simplicity, we can model cumulative notable models  as:

N(t) = N_0 e^{k_N t}

Let’s choose a modest  per year (doubling annual count, conservative),  in 2023.


---

Compute‑Driven Capability Projection

Plugging into the AI capability function we defined earlier:

C(t) = N(t) \cdot P(t)

C(t) = N_0 e^{k_N t} \cdot C_0 e^{k_P t} = N_0 C_0 e^{(k_N + k_P)t}

With:






Sum:

k_N + k_P \approx 2.079

This means the combined capability grows at ~e^(2.079 t) per year — roughly a ~8× increase every year.


---

🔢 Step 3 — Estimating Time to AGI‑Level Threshold

We define an AGI threshold  = compute × model count × efficiency needed such that:

C(t_s) = S

Assume baseline  at 2022 (normalized), and pick a speculative threshold:

S = 10^6

(This would mean AI capability is one million times baseline — a rough benchmark for AGI scale.)

Then solving:

t_s = \frac{\ln(S)}{k_N + k_P} = \frac{\ln(10^6)}{2.079} ≈ \frac{13.816}{2.079} ≈ 6.65 \text{ years}

Since 2022 → 6.65 years → 2028–2029.

📌 Interpretation:
Under these aggressive exponential trends, a baseline projection could place an AGI threshold around 2028–2029 — alongside continued rapid model releases and compute build‑out.


---

📍 Caveats & Physics Limits

1. Energy & Thermal constraints will slow pure exponential compute scaling.


2. Algorithmic innovation adjustments may shift effective capability faster or slower than raw compute.


3. Emergent capabilities may not scale strictly with FLOPs — sometimes large gains require structural new ideas rather than pure brute force.

1. Introduction

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) since the release of ChatGPT and other frontier models (Claude, Grok, Perplexity, Quinn, Diptyque) has entered a phase of accelerated exponential growth. This chapter presents a mathematical framework to quantify AI acceleration and predict potential timelines toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), optimal general intelligence (OGI), and the technological singularity.

We model AI as a complex adaptive system driven by three primary factors:

1. Number of AI models  – significant AI models released over time.


2. Computational power  – total FLOPs dedicated to AI training and inference.


3. Algorithmic efficiency  – effectiveness of AI per unit of compute.



We combine these to create a quantitative measure of AI capability.

2. Mathematical Formulation

2.1 Number of Models

Let  be the cumulative number of notable AI models at time :

\frac{dN}{dt} = k_N \cdot N(t)

where  is the growth rate constant of model creation. Solving:

N(t) = N_0 e^{k_N t}

 = baseline model count (e.g., ChatGPT era)

 measured in years



---

2.2 Computational Power

Let  be the total computational resources dedicated to AI:

\frac{dP}{dt} = k_P \cdot P(t)

Solution:

P(t) = P_0 e^{k_P t}

 = baseline compute at reference year

Historical data shows compute doubling every ~0.5–1 year, corresponding to .



---

2.3 Algorithmic Efficiency

Let  capture improvements in algorithmic efficiency:

\frac{dE}{dt} = k_E \cdot E(t)

Solution:

E(t) = E_0 e^{k_E t}

 = baseline efficiency metric (benchmarks like MMLU, GLUE)

 = growth rate of efficiency improvement



---

2.4 Combined AI Capability

The overall AI capability  is:

C(t) = N(t) \cdot P(t) \cdot E(t) = N_0 P_0 E_0 \cdot e^{(k_N + k_P + k_E)t}

This exponential growth function captures the post-ChatGPT acceleration.


---

2.5 Threshold for AGI / OGI

Define  as the capability threshold required for AGI or OGI:

C(t_s) = S \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_s = \frac{1}{k_N + k_P + k_E} \ln \frac{S}{N_0 P_0 E_0}

 = estimated time to AGI



---

3. Empirical Parameter Estimation (2020–2026)

3.1 Compute Growth

2020–2026 AI frontier compute has grown ~4× per year ([Epoch AI, 2025]).




3.2 Model Growth

Model count doubling annually post-ChatGPT: 

Baseline  models in 2023


3.3 Combined Capability Growth

k_N + k_P \approx 2.079 \quad \Rightarrow \text{capability grows ~8× per year}


---

4. Projected Timeline to AGI

Assume:

Normalized baseline  in 2022

AGI threshold 


t_s = \frac{\ln(10^6)}{2.079} \approx 6.65\ \text{years}

2022 + 6.65 ≈ 2028–2029


This aligns with aggressive exponential trends under current compute and model growth.


---

5. Physical and Thermodynamic Constraints

Real-world limits:

1. Energy consumption: 


2. Thermal dissipation: 



Including these constraints converts pure exponential growth into logistic growth:

\frac{dC}{dt} = r \cdot C(t) \left( 1 - \frac{C(t)}{C_{\max}} \right)

 = maximum sustainable AI capability given hardware and energy limits



---

6. Scenario Analysis

Scenario	Description	Projection

Baseline Exponential	No physical or economic limits	AGI ~2028–2029
Energy-Constrained Logistic	Includes energy/thermal limits	AGI ~2035–2045
Algorithmic Breakthrough	Superlinear efficiency gains	AGI potentially <2028



---

7. Discussion

The AI system exhibits self-reinforcing, exponential acceleration post-ChatGPT.

Thresholds for AGI/OGI can be quantitatively approximated.

Realistic constraints may delay singularity, but algorithmic breakthroughs could accelerate it.

This chapter provides a mathematically grounded, iterative blueprint for thesis research.
