Executive Summary

As of December 2025, the race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has entered an unprecedented acceleration phase. Multiple labs now predict AGI-level capabilities within 2-4 years, while geopolitical tensions have created a classic security dilemma: no major power dares to unilaterally slow AI development for fear of strategic disadvantage. The window for preventative global coordination has effectively closed.

This document presents the IAGH (Intelligence Artificielle Gardienne de l'Humanité) Framework—not as a last-minute prevention strategy, but as a practical technical safety standard and crisis response protocol that responsible nations can implement immediately to mitigate inevitable AI-related catastrophes and prepare for post-crisis reconstruction.

Core Strategy: The Coalition of the Prudent

The IAGH Framework adopts a realistic three-pronged approach:

1. Immediate Technical Implementation: Mandatory hardware-enforced safety constraints (Trusted Execution Environments with cryptographic licensing) for all high-risk AI systems within participating nations.
2. Regulatory Fortification: Establishment of National AI Safety Agencies (NASAg) with authority to license, monitor, and—if necessary—disable advanced AI systems, backed by export controls that make non-compliance economically prohibitive.
3. Crisis Preparedness: Development of proven response protocols for multiple AI failure scenarios, ensuring that when incidents occur (as they inevitably will), humanity has tested procedures rather than chaotic improvisation.

Current Context (December 2025)

· AGI Timeline: Leading labs now estimate 40% probability of AGI by 2027, 80% by 2030
· Compute Growth: AI training runs have exceeded 10²⁵ FLOPs, with 10²⁶ FLOP runs announced for 2026
· Geopolitical Stance: No major power has agreed to meaningful development constraints
· Safety Lag: Technical AI safety research remains underfunded (≤5% of AI investment)
· Regulatory Gap: No jurisdiction has implemented hardware-level safety requirements

The IAGH Framework represents a pragmatic middle path between inaction and utopianism: building defensive infrastructure today that will either prevent some accidents, contain others, or at minimum provide the institutional templates needed for governance when political conditions change post-crisis.

1. Introduction: The Closing Window and the Imperative of Preparedness

1.1 The Historical Pattern Repeats

Technological governance has consistently followed rather than led innovation. Meaningful safety regulations for nuclear energy, aviation, pharmaceuticals, and financial systems universally emerged only after catastrophic failures demonstrated the consequences of inaction. The current AI development trajectory follows this exact pattern.

1.2 The 2025 Reality Check

Three critical developments in late 2025 have altered the strategic landscape:

1. The Compute Threshold Breach: Training runs exceeding 10²⁵ FLOPs have demonstrated emergent capabilities that even their creators cannot reliably predict or control.
2. The Deteriorating Trust Environment: Geopolitical tensions have collapsed previously existing channels for AI safety dialogue between major powers.
3. The Corporate Acceleration Dynamic: Private sector AI development has decisively outpaced governmental oversight capabilities, with regulatory lag now measured in years rather than months.

1.3 Strategic Pivot: From Prevention to Resilience

Given these realities, the IAGH Framework abandons the fiction of preventing all risky AI development and instead focuses on:

· Mitigation: Reducing the probability and severity of AI incidents through inherent safety design
· Containment: Building technical and institutional capacity to limit damage when incidents occur
· Reconstruction: Preparing the governance templates needed for post-crisis recovery

This is not a counsel of despair but a strategy of realistic preparedness—building the lifeboats while acknowledging the storm's inevitability.

2. The IAGH Technical Framework: Mandatory Safety Standards for High-Risk AI

2.1 Core Design Philosophy: Inherent Constraints Over Added Safeguards

The IAGH Framework adopts the engineering principle that safety must be architecturally fundamental, not procedurally additional. We design systems where unsafe operation is physically difficult or impossible, analogous to dead man's switches in trains or containment vessels in nuclear reactors.

2.2 Hardware Layer: Trusted Execution Environments with Mandatory Material Classification

2.2.1 Risk-Based Hardware Classification

Effective January 1, 2026, all AI accelerator hardware (GPU/TPU/NPU) sold or used within IAGH jurisdictions falls into three regulatory categories:

Category Compute Threshold Safety Requirements Regulatory Status
ME Class (Existential Threat) ≥10²⁶ FLOPs capability Full IAGH TEE compliance required Pre-market approval, continuous monitoring
MS Class (Systemic Threat) 10²⁴ - 10²⁶ FLOPs Basic TEE required, licensing optional Registration required, random audits
Standard Class <10²⁴ FLOPs Voluntary compliance Market self-regulation

2.2.2 Technical Specifications for ME-Class Hardware

All ME-Class hardware must implement:

1. Hardware-Rooted Trust: A physically immutable root of trust establishing a chain of custody from fabrication to deployment.
2. Mandatory Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):
   · Enforces cryptographically signed licenses specifying absolute resource limits (maximum sustained FLOP/s, memory allocation, network bandwidth)
   · Implements progressive throttling (25% → 50% → 75% → 100% reduction) upon license expiration or violation detection
   · Contains physical kill-switches that can be triggered remotely by authorized NASAg personnel
   · Maintains tamper-evident logs of all constraint checks and violations in write-only memory
3. Default-Locked Operation: Ships in a permanently throttled state (≤10²⁴ FLOPs) that can only be unlocked with a valid NASAg-issued cryptographic license.
4. Anti-Tampering Protections: Common Criteria EAL6+ certification against physical and side-channel attacks.

2.2.3 IAGH Export Control Agreement (IAGH-ECA)

To ensure global manufacturer compliance, IAGH member states implement coordinated export controls:

Article 1: Market Access Conditioning
No AI accelerator hardware may be imported into IAGH jurisdiction without:

· IAGH certification for its designated class
· Pre-registration of serial numbers in the distributed hardware registry
· Manufacturer agreement to security audits of firmware update processes

Article 2: Enforcement Mechanisms

· Customs authorities deploy non-invasive scanners detecting ME-Class hardware signatures
· Cloud providers operating in IAGH jurisdictions must certify 100% compliance for ME-Class infrastructure
· Financial institutions are prohibited from processing payments for non-compliant AI hardware

Article 3: Penalty Structure

· Manufacturers: 5-year market exclusion for first violation, permanent exclusion for second
· Importers: Asset seizure plus fines up to 300% of hardware value
· End Users: Hardware confiscation plus suspension of AI development licenses

2.3 Operational Layer: National AI Safety Agencies (NASAg)

2.3.1 Institutional Design and Authority

Each participating nation establishes a NASAg with the following mandatory powers:

Licensing Authority:

· Issues time-bound, project-specific cryptographic licenses for ME-Class hardware activation
· Maintains a real-time license registry accessible to all IAGH member agencies
· Can remotely revoke licenses for violations or emergency containment

1. Hardware Provenance: Chain of custody from fabrication to current location
2. License Status: Real-time validity of all activation licenses
3. Compliance History: Tamper-proof record of all violations and incidents
4. Emergency Contacts: Designated response personnel for each deployment

6. Conclusion: Realistic Preparation in an Age of Acceleration

As of December 2025, humanity stands at a threshold familiar from other transformative technologies but unprecedented in scale and speed. The development of artificial intelligence at human and then superhuman levels presents both extraordinary promise and existential risk. The uncomfortable truth is that comprehensive prevention of all risks is now impossible—the competitive and geopolitical dynamics are too entrenched, the technological momentum too great.

The IAGH Framework represents a clear-eyed alternative to both complacency and despair. It acknowledges that:

1. Some accidents are now inevitable given the pace of unconstrained development
2. Preparation can nevertheless save lives and preserve institutions when those accidents occur
3. Building safety infrastructure today creates options tomorrow that would not otherwise exist

This is not a proposal to govern AI from the top down in a world that rejects such governance. It is a bottom-up construction of resilience—the technical standards, institutional capacity, and expert networks that will either:

· Prevent some accidents through inherent safety design
· Contain the damage when accidents inevitably occur
· Provide the foundation for more comprehensive governance when political conditions change after the first major crisis

The nations implementing this framework are not declaring victory over the AI safety problem. They are acknowledging that while we may not prevent the storm, we can build lifeboats, train crews, and chart safer courses for whatever comes after.

The alternative—doing nothing while hoping either for perfect coordination or perfect luck—is not a strategy but a surrender. History shows that technologies this powerful eventually demand serious governance. The only question is whether we build that governance capacity proactively or attempt to create it amid catastrophe.

We choose preparation. We invite all nations, organizations, and researchers who share this commitment to join us in building the technical and institutional foundations for a future where advanced AI systems are powerful tools rather than existential threats.
